    "In order to work with the \"time\" column in our data, we first had to clean it up. Since different countries use different time formatting, and the people who compiled the original data were inconsistent, the column for time was very messy. Luckily, another Kaggle user took the time to write code which uses regular expressions to put the times in a more useable format. This author is Melikşah Gürcü, and his code can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mackali/data-analyses-of-airplane-crashes/notebook). We give full credit to Gürcü for the code used in the cell below, and greatly appreciate his helpful contribution. "

       "'During a demonstration flight, a U.S. Army flyer flown by Orville Wright nose-dived into the ground from a height of approximately 75 feet, killing Lt. Thomas E. Selfridge, 26, who was a passenger. This was the first recorded airplane fatality in history.  One of two propellers separated in flight, tearing loose the wires bracing the rudder and causing the loss of control of the aircraft.  Orville Wright suffered broken ribs, pelvis and a leg.  Selfridge suffered a crushed skull and died a short time later.,First U.S. dirigible Akron exploded just offshore at an altitude of 1,000 ft. during a test flight.,The airship flew into a thunderstorm and encountered a severe downdraft crashing 20 miles north of Helgoland Island into the sea. The ship broke in two and the control car immediately sank drowning its occupants.,Hydrogen gas which was being vented was sucked into the forward engine and ignited causing the airship to explode and burn at 3,000 ft..,Crashed into trees while attempting to land after being shot down by British and French aircraft.,Exploded and burned near Neuwerk Island,  when hydrogen gas, being vented, was ignited by lightning.,Shot down by British aircraft crashing in flames.,Shot down in flames by the British 39th Home Defence Squadron.,Shot down by British anti-aircraft fire and aircraft and crashed into the North Sea.,Crashed into the sea from an altitude of 3,000 ft. after being hit by British aircraft fire.,Shot down by British aircraft.,Shot down by British aircraft.,Shot down by French anti-aircraft fire.,Exploded and crashed into the sea off the southern coast of Italy.,Shot down by british aircraft.,The plane failed to gain altitude after taking off and crashed into a tree and a house. Pilot error in taking off towards a hill in unfavorable wind conditions and fog.The first commercial air disaster to result in passenger fatalities during a regularly scheduled service..,Crashed due to structural failure followed by two explosions and a fire. Attributed to faulty design.,The plane ditched into the ocean about 40 miles East of Florida after a propeller blade broke. Only the pilot survived, being picked up over 2 days later. The flying boat was named Miss Miami.,A midair collision occurred at 400 ft. in poor visibility approximately 18 miles north of Beauvais, France. The pilots of both planes were using the road as a route marker in bad weather and poor visibility. This was the  first commercial midair collision in aviation history. Two killed on the de Havilland, five on the Faman F-60.,Lost an engine and could not make an emergency landing because of gusty winds. Stalled while making a turn and crashed.,Broke-up in mid air after suffering structural failure at 3,000 ft. after a onboard fire weakened the plane\\'s structure losing a wing. Possibly started by a passenger discarding a match after lighting a cigarette.,Crashed while attempting a forced landing after encountering heavy rain.,Crashed while on a flight from Toulon, France to Algiers, Algeria.  The last known radio contact reported the ship nearly out of fuel and battling strong winds.  Struck by lightning.,Shortly after taking off, witnesses observed a puff of white smoke after which the plane nose-dived into the ground. Fuel starvation. Captain Stewart and seven passengers were killed in an attempted forced landing.,The Shenandoah was flying over Southern Ohio when she abruptly encountered violent atmospheric conditions (thunderstorms). Powerful air currents buffeted her so severely that her crew was unable to maintain control. Rising rapidly above her pressure height, then falling and rising again, her hull structure was overstressed amidships, breaking the airship in two. Shenandoah\\'s external control car and two engine cars fell free, carrying the dirigible\\'s commanding officer and several other men to their deaths.

A design flaw caused an oscillation known as  mode to transfer propeller wobble to the outboard nacelles which induced flutter in the wing which led to the separation of the wing. One of two accidents with the same cause. See 3/17/1960.,Crashed on approach. Crew\\'s handling of the plane led to a premature loss of altitude and collision with obstacles.,Moments after rotation the left engine exploded and caught fire. The elevator of the plane hit a 12,000 volt powerline and crash landed upright sliding 65 feet. The only fatality was the first officer who was thrown clear of the accident still strapped to his seat. The number 5 cylinder of the left engine failed leading to an explosion that deformed the left engine\\'s ring cowl to a degree that cause excessive drag and buffeting that made sustained flight impossible. Maintenance records showed the engine had a troubling number of oil leaks.,Engine failure on takeoff. The plane crashed 5 minutes later. Failure of the gudgeon pin bearing of the No.6 piston of the left engine.,Crashed into Bucks Elbow Mountain during an ILS approach to Charlottesville Airport. Navigational omission resulting in an off course approach. It took thirty-six hours before the lone survivor was rescued.  A navigational omission which resulted in a lateral course error that was not detected and corrected through precision instrument flying procedures. A contributing factor to the accident may have been pre-occupation of the captain resulting from mental stress.,The cargo plane exploded in midair while en route after an engine fire.,The aircraft crashed into the Gulf of Mexico at 29 degrees 13 minutes N, 88 degrees 40 minutes W or about 108 miles east-southeast of New Orleans, while on a flight from Tampa to New Orleans. Sabotage (explosion of a dynamite bomb aboard) was strongly suspected but could never be proven due to lack of physical evidence.  There is a possibility that there is a connection between this crash and the National Airlines crash of January 6, 1960. No one was charged in either case.,Shortly after taking off the plane experienced a fire warning in the No. 2 engine, shut it down and attempted to return to Midway Airport. During the final approach the aircraft banked in excess of 45 degrees and developed an excessive sink rate. When the aircraft reached the tops of trees its wings were nearly level and its nose was raised in a climbing attitude but the descent continued and the plane crashed one quarter of a mile southeast of the airport. The accident was the consequence of manuvering the aircraft during the turn to final approach in such a manner as to cause a rate of sink from which recovery was not possible. Sometime during the turn the flaps were retracted from 60% to 24% causing a loss of lift.,Crashed into Bald Eagle Mountain,13 miles south of Williamsport,  while on an ILS approach to Williamsport.  Probable accidental caging of the fluxgate compass leading to a erroneous heading indication. Captain\\'s failure to execute a timely abandoned approach. There was one passenger who survived.,Disappeared en route. Right landing gear found on Moron Island.  Cause undetermined.,Crashed into a mountain while en route. Crew error. The crew deviated from prescribe route.,The cargo plane cashed en route after reporting engine trouble.,Crashed into a hanger during a practice landing.

The pilot of the trainer parachuted to safety. All 32 aboard the Viscount were killed when it crashed into several houses in the district of Ramos. Failure of both pilots to see and avoid each other. Apparently, the pilot of the trainer aircraft was not supposed to cross the approach path of the Viscount.,Shortly after takeoff the cargo plane lost the No. 2 engine, tried to return to the airport but crashed. Failure of the right engine, a lack of precaution on the part of the captain and marginal weather. A contributing factor may have been the overloaded condition of the aircraft, however, not to such an extent that it forced the aircraft to descend to a dangerously low altitude.,The cargo plane crashed while dropping supplies and making a narrow turn in a valley. The accident was attributed to an error in navigation which caused the pilot to enter the wrong valley. During an attempt to turn back in a restricted area, the aircraft stalled and crashed.,The plane disintegrated in flight at 18,000 feet and crashed 1.5 miles northwest of Bolivia, North Carolina. Detonation of a dynamite bomb by means of dry cell batteries, in the vicinity of row 7, in the passenger cabin.  The plane continued to fly for a short time after which the fuselage came apart and the plane crashed in a ball of flames. Julian Frank, who had purchased 1 million dollars in insurance, was suspected of committing suicide by detonating the bomb in his lap or under his seat. There is a possibility Frank may have been an unwitting bomb carrier and that this bombing has something to do with the National Airlines crash of November, 16, 1959. No one was charged in either case.,Missing, never found.,The aircraft crashed and burned in a wooded area, striking the ground in a level attitude. The delayed arming of the engine ice-protection systems while flying through icing conditions, causing eventual flame-out of the four engines. This condition existed for sufficient time to cause a drop in battery electrical energy, preventing the unfeathering and relighting of sufficient engines to maintain flight. The aircraft was then dived in an  effort to attain sufficient airspeed to drive the propellers out of the feathered positions by wind-milling.  At the same time, multiple attempts were made to relight one or more engines. Successful relights were either interrupted by auto-feather action initiated by premature advancing of the throttles prior to complete light up of an engine or prevented by insufficient battery electrical energy. No. 4 engine was eventually  relit and the crew had just successfully relit No. 3 engine when the aircraft crashed.,While on a flight from Istanbul to Ankara, Turkey the aircraft crashed while on approach to Esenboga Airport, 6 nm short of the runway. The aircraft struck the ground at an elevation of 3,500 ft, between the Ankara mountain range and the airport.

Members of the United States Navy Band among those killed.,The plane crashed into a swamp short of the runway threshold. Icing of the horizontal stabilizer.,An in-flight separation of the wing. A design flaw caused an oscillation known as whirl mode to transfer propeller wobble to the outboard nacelles which induced flutter in the wing which led to the separation of the wing. Reduced stiffness of the structure and the entry of the aircraft into an area of severe clear air turbulence were contributing factors. One of two crashes with the same cause.  See 9/29/59.,Forced landing after engine failure. The accident was attributed to an error in judgment by the pilot in deciding to land at an airport which was closed and where no radio aid was available. Contributing factors were intermittent overspeeding of propellers, adverse weather and no communication tower.,Flew into a hill shortly after taking off.

Misjudgment of the terrain clearance, which resulted in the collision with trees in severe turbulence and strong gusty winds.,The incurrence of reverse thrust during simulated failure of no. 4 engine on takeoff. That condition arose when very rapid rearward movement of the power level generated an inertia force which caused the associated thrust brake lever to rise and enter the reverse idle detent. After lift-off, the minimum control speed essentially required to overcome the prevailing state of thrust imbalance was never attained and an uncontrollable roll, accompanied by some degree of yaw and sideslip in the same direction, ensued. When the condition of reverse thrust was recognized and eliminated, insufficient time and height were available to allow the aircraft to recover from its precarious attitude before it struck the ground.,Struck mountain slope while in level flight.

The plane sank after 5 minutes.  One passenger refused to leave the aircraft and drowned.,About 150 miles from Longreach, fire was reported in No. 1 and 2 engines. While the plane was making an emergency descent, the left wing broke away due to weakening by the fire. After failure of the wing, the plane broke up in mid-air and crashed. Loosened bolts led to the loss of the oil lubricating unit causing the bearings to heat and catching the engines on fire. Subsequently, a locking mechanism was installed on the bolts to prevent any future accidents of this kind.,The cargo plane struck trees at the end of the runway after trying to make an emergency landing. Material failure consisting in fatigue failure of a number of teeth of the pinion of the governor control unit, which was jammed against the rack in the \\'up\\' position and therefore set for maximum rpm, thus causing the engine to overspeed. This would be in keeping with the fact that the dome ring was at maximum low pitch setting, i.e. high rpm and a runway propeller on take-off.,The plane crashed into Salmon Mountain while on approach to Portland. The pilots evidently had agreed to maintain 9,000 feet, but descended instead. The aircraft hit the mountain at the 3,830-foot level of a 4,090-foot ridge.

Improper IFR operation.,Flight 9877 was scheduled to provide crew training for a captain trainee and a flight engineer trainee. In addition the flight engineer instructor was being given a routine proficiency check. The flight departed the ramp at 00:40 with the captain trainee in the left seat and the check captain in the right seat. At 00:43 the crew advised the tower they were ready for takeoff and would like to circle and land on Runway 1. The tower cleared them as requested. The aircraft was observed to make what appeared to be a normal takeoff and departure. At 00:47 the crew reported on base leg for Runway 1, and the controller cleared the flight to land. A subsequent discussion revealed that they would execute a simulated two-engine out approach, execute a full stop landing and then takeoff on runway 19. The tower controller observed Flight 9877 in a shallow left turn on what appeared to be a normal final approach.

The aircraft overran the runway and crashed and burned. The inability of the TWA crew to abort successfully their takeoff at the speed attained prior to the attempted abort. The abort was understandably initiated because of the first officer\\'s belief that his plane had collided with a Delta aircraft stopped just off the runway. A contributing factor was the action of the Delta crew in advising the tower that their plane was clear of the runway without carefully ascertaining the facts, and when in fact their aircraft was not a safe distance under the circumstances of another aircraft taking off on that runway.,The plane climbed to 700 ft. and crashed into the ground. Malfunctioning artificial horizon and compass.,The aircraft struck a tree short of the runway during an approach in snow. Procedural errors by the crew during the approach in adverse weather.

The failure of the crew to perform a pre-takeoff control check resulting in takeoff with the elevators immobilized by a control batten.,During poor weather and after a flyby, the pilot requested a Runway 18 approach. The pilot decided to make a visual approach along the middle of 3 diverging roads, which was aligned with the runway. Because of the fog, the pilot began his approach along the third road which extended to the Royal Thai Air Force fuel storage instead of Runway 18. When the aircraft got close to the ground, the pilot realized that he was approaching the wrong road. He tried to initiate a go-around but the aircraft became unstable as he raised the nose slipped to the left and stalled the plane. The No.1 engine hit the ground first, 200 meters from the airport.,During the approach to airplane was high above the glide slope. At an altitude of 250 m, 4 km from the runway, the crew added takeoff power and performed  a missed approach. Simultaneously  the right engine lost power.

Executed steep climb and turn at 50 ft.,The aircraft hit Mt. Tobin 300 ft. below the peak and slid 1,000 ft. down the side of the mountain. Turbulent conditions caused the uncontrolled descent. The Salt Lake control center had, in response to its vector request, informed the crew that there were no storm cells and no reports of icing along the airway being used. As a result, the pilot was unaware that turbulence encountered would be hazardous, worse than that predicted at the time of take-off. These turbulent conditions apparently caused the uncontrolled descent of the aircraft into the ground. The pilot was technically not qualified for the type of aircraft and was aware of the general weather conditions and should have discontinued the flight..,Ice accretion on the lifting surface of the aircraft accompanied by moderate to severe turbulence, which resulted in loss of aircraft control by the pilot. When he tried to regain control over the aircraft the lifting surfaces were loaded beyond approved design limits, which brought about the disintegration of main parts of the aircraft in the air, and its subsequent impact with the ground.,Vanished without a trace over the Himalayas while en route. The remains of one victim from the plane were found in the Rohtang Pass in August 2003. The wreckage itself and other remains would be found in August 2005.

It crashed 20 miles from the airfield it intended to make an emergency landing at.,The aircraft crashed into Moose Mountain during an approach. Execution of a non-standard approach.  Premature descent. The crew was not able to determine accurately its position because they had performed a non-standard instrument approach and there were no supplement navigational aids available for their use.,Engine failure on climb out for undetermined reasons. Aircraft allowed to enter condition of asymmetrical thrust. Improper emergency procedures. Aircraft overloaded by 475 lbs.,The plane landed in the shallow waters of San Francisco Bay, 2.5 mile short of the Runway 28L. All 107 people aboard were safely evacuated off the plane without injury. According to the NTSB, the captain said he was making a coupled approach, but because of problems with his pressure altimeter, he was relying on the more accurate radio altimeter for verification of altitude. The captain looked up expecting to be 200 feet above the water but instead was nearly in the water. He applied power but it was too late. The captain did not cross-check the raw data glide-slope signals and didn\\'t realize the ILS on-course position was far above where he was. The  improper application of the prescribed procedures to execute an automatic-coupled ILS approach. This deviation from the prescribed procedures was, in part, due t o a lack of familiarization and infrequent operation of the installed flight director and autopilot system.  As a result, Japan Air Lines changed their training procedures to stress command responsibilities, crew coordination and transition time for new type of aircraft.

Possibilities include an altimeter failure or misreading of the instrument approach chart.,The aircraft was on approach to 07R when it crashed into Santa Monica Bay 6 miles short of the runway. The fuselage  broke into 3 pieces one of which floated for 20 hours. SAS did not authorize a back course approach to LAX.  A VOR approach was conducted without notifying the controlling authority. The crew was preoccupied with a landing gear light problem. Lack of crew coordination and inadequate monitoring of aircraft position which resulted in an unplanned descent into the water. The aircraft was named \"Sverre Viking.\",The aircraft crashed into Santa Monica Bay shortly after a night takeoff in poor weather and visibility. The aircraft was dispatched with the No. 3 generator inoperative. While this was allowed, United was required to repair the generator at the first airport where there were repair facilities. The aircraft flew for a total of 41 hours with the inoperative generator passing through airports that had the facilities to repair the generator. Soon after taking off, the crew reported a fire warning in the No. 1 engine and shut it down as required. For reasons that could not be determined, shutting down the No. 1 engine and it’s generator tripped the No.2 generator resulting in the loss of all electrical power in the aircraft. Following loss of all electrical power, the battery standby electrical system either was not activated or failed to function. Electrical power at a voltage level of approximately 50 volts was restored approximately a minute and a half after loss of the No. 2 generator. The duration of this power restoration was just 9 to 15 seconds. Regardless, the pilots did not have functioning attitude indicators from the time the No. 2 generator tripped. In the dark, with no outside or inside reference to guide them, the pilots became spatially disoriented and the plane eventually went into a dive and crashed into the Pacific Ocean 11.3 miles west of the airport and sank in 950 ft. of water. The accident was caused by the loss of attitude orientation during a night, instrument departure in which all attitude instruments were disabled by loss of electrical power. The investigation was not able to determine (a) why all generator power was lost or (b) why the standby electrical power system either was not activated or failed to function.\" One unproven scenario that is not contradicted by available evidence was the inadvertent placement of the battery switch to the \"OFF\" position by the flight engineer during attempts to remove galley loads from the generator buses. The galley switches were similar in shape and size, and were located on the flight engineer\\'s upper panel in close proximity to the battery switch. Following the accident, the flight engineer’s panel was redesigned to place a guard over the battery switch.,The plane crashed after a premature liftoff for unknown reasons.,Inadvertent contact with the water during low-level flight over open ocean while searching for survivors.,The flight designated \"gambler\\'s special\" flew into  Mt.

Contributing factors were improper flight planning and a malfunction in the No.2 engine which caused a higher than normal fuel consumption.,After lifting a water container the aircraft began rotating until control was lost and contact was made with the ground, shearing off the tail rotor and a large portion of the tail assembly. New engines were installed in the CH-53s to increase the power of the main rotor and on a whole to make the helicopter more powerful. However, it was soon evident that the tail rotor could not balance the increased power created by the main rotor. Under certain conditions the aircraft would become unstable and lose directional heading. Sikorsky warns of these conditions. To compensate for the mistake that had been made, Sikorsky designed and tested a bell crank system to stabilize the rear rotor. After seven years, this helicopter was still not retrofitted with the bell crank system. Gross weight of the container exceeded the lifting capacity of the helicopter.

Unfamiliarity of the crew with the landing field and lack of planning for the flyby.,The civilian Iranian airliner was shot down by the U.S. Navy vessel U.S.S. Vincennes with surface-to-air missiles. The Vincennes was protecting other civilian ships in the area from Iranian gunboats. The Vincennes responded to hostile action taking place against a ship by Iranian gun boats. However, orders to the captain were to send a helicopter to investigate but maintain position. In fact, the ship headed towards the hostilities and penetrated 2nm inside Iranian territorial waters and after the helicopter was fired upon, engaged the enemy boats. The ill-fated airliner was delayed in leaving Bandar Abbas because of a problem with the passport of a passenger. Soon after taking off the target appeared on the radar of the Vincennes. Because the plane was late and confusion of time zones, the crew was not expecting an airliner in the area. When the target was first identified, it squawked both 2 (military) and 3 (civilian). The reason for this was the radar tracker ball was left in the vicinity of the Bandar Abbas airport and the radar was picking up both the airliner and a military F-14 jet fighter at the same time. Playing it safe, the plane was misidentified as a F-14 Iranian fighter. The aircraft did not respond to 10 radio challenges from the Vincennes. However, 7 were on military frequencies which the airliner could not pick up. Three were on the civil emergency frequency addressed to the so called military F-14. When the plane was nearing 10 miles from the ship, it was reported to the captain that the aircraft was descending. At that time the surface-to-air missiles were fired destroying the aircraft. At the inquiry computer data showed that the plane was never descending and actually was ascending at a steady rate. Incredibly, a military investigation concluded that although the U.S. government regretted the loss of human life, the captain and crew were not at fault and acted properly in shooting down the airliner.,The cargo plane ran out of fuel and crashed into a dirt bank .

Non-standard phraseology used by Kuala Lumpur ATC, causing the crew to misinterpret the instructions.,After leaving Honolulu, on a flight from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia, the loss of an improperly latched forward lower lobe cargo door resulted in explosive decompression and loss of power in the No. 3 and 4 engines. Nine passengers were sucked out of the plane and lost at sea. The plane landed safely. The cargo door opening was attributed to a faulty switch or wiring in the door control system which permitted electrical actuation of the door latches towards the unlatched position after initial door closure and before takeoff. As a failsafe, the latches should have been blocked from moving by a mechanism called a \"locking sector\" (one on each latch), engaged manually by a lever after the door is closed.  However, the locking sectors as designed were not strong enough and could be overcome by the motors which was a design flaw right from the introduction of the747.  This was finally recognized as serious, after a non-fatal failure in 1987, but installing stronger locking sectors required taking each plane out of service 10 hours, and the FAA had allowed airlines 18 months so they could do it during other maintenance procedures.,The cargo plane crashed after its initial climb.,While flying from Thunder Bay, Ontario to Winnipeg, Manitoba, the plane crashed on take-off from Dryden, Ontario. The aircraft failed to gain altitude, settled back down on the runway and then took off for a second time clipping the tops of  trees, causing debris to clog the engines leading to the plane crashing. The aircraft was being refueled with one engine running because of an unserviceable APU. Since no external power unit was available at the airport the engine could not be shut down and deicing could not be performed. The captain\\'s decision to take off  in deteriorating weather conditions with an accumulation of snow and ice on the wings.  Decision not to de-ice the plane before taking off. The failure of the Canadian air transport system in placing the crew in a situation where they did not have the resources to make a proper decision.,While landing the cargo plane pitched down and crashed short of the runway.

After a missed approach and during  a go-around, the plane ran out of fuel and crashed in a wooded area. The captain speaking very little English and communicating through the first officer, at no time declared an emergency. The first officer used the term \"we need priority\" several times, rather than declaring an emergency. The ATC did not realize the peril of the aircraft. Failure of the crew to properly communicate the emergency situation to the ATC. Although blame was placed squarely on the crew there are several reasons why ATC should have  taken some responsibility for the accident. ATC was trying to land too many planes at once given the weather and number of missed approaches and aborted landing that were taking place. The plane was put in an extended holding pattern on three different occasions. The crew was not told of wind shear below 500 ft. which led to the aborted landing attempt. The plane was passed between three different controllers as it came out of its holding pattern to land. Each time the crew had to repeat their fuel situation.  The crew did say \"we are running out of fuel\" numerous times only to be taken on a wide circling pattern after the first attempt at landing was aborted.

Thirteen killed on each helicopter.,While on ILS approach to Nagoya Airport, at an altitude of 1,000 feet, the first officer inadvertently triggered the TOGA (take-off-go-around) lever. The crew tried to override this situation by turning off the autothrottle and reducing air speed. The aircraft stalled, hit the runway tail first and burst into flames. The plane crashed because of an extreme out of trim configuration brought about by the fact that the tailplane setting had moved automatically and undetected to a maximum nose-up position. The plane climbed at a steep angle until it stalled. The crew could have saved the aircraft even in the final seconds had they reverted to basic flight procedures and switched off the autopilot.,Landed in fog, overrunning the runway and crashing into a blast fence. The failure of the captain to use the available ILS glideslope, his failure to execute a go-around when conditions were not suitable for landing, and his failure to land the airplane at a point sufficient to allow for a safe stopping distance; the fatalities were caused by the presence of the nonfrangible blast fence and the absence of a safety area at the end of the runway,Crashed into a mountain while inbound for Bogota.,Crashed while making an emergency landing following engine trouble.,Crashed shortly after taking off after double engine failure.,The helicopter crashed into The Mountain of the Stone Slab at an elevation of 800 ft.

The approach was flown with slats/flaps at 15/20 degrees due to suspected windshear. Crew error. There was a struggle and argument between the captain and co-pilot during the last seconds of the landing as to whether they should go-around.,The pilot flew into a blind box canyon and crashed while attempting to turn around. Improper in-flight planning /decision by the pilot and his failure to remain clear of mountainous terrain. The box canyon and proximity of mountains were related factors.,The non-instrument rated commercial pilot was en route at 2000 feet msl on a night VFR flight when he reported an inadvertent encounter with instrument meteorological conditions. The helicopter (N124NH) subsequently crashed in a wooded area while in a steep descent. Continued VFR flight into IMC.,Suffered engine failure and made a crash landing on terrain near the shoreline of a body of water. Fatigue cracking of the engine case, which resulted in eventual damage to the #3 cylinder studs/engine through-bolts, subsequent separation of the #3 cylinder and piston, and an in-flight fire. Inadequate maintenance and inspection.,While on approach, the aircraft went into a sudden nose dive from 6,000 ft. and crashed into a wooded ravine 6 miles northwest of Pittsburgh International Airport. The accident was caused by a loss of control of the aircraft resulting from the movement of the rudder surface to its blowdown limit or an uncommanded rudder reversal. The rudder surface deflected in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots as a result of a jam of the main rudder PCU servo valve secondary slide to the servo valve housing offset from its neutral position and overtravel of the  primary slide. The most likely sequence of events that led up to the accident included the jamming of the PCU servo valve, the application of light left rudder followed by hard right rudder which caused the rudder to reverse in the opposite direction the pilot commanded it to go.  The application of hard right rudder was possibly initiated because the plane flew into the wake vortex of a B-727 which rolled the plane to the left.  Rudder hardover is normally corrected with the stick (ailerons) but because the plane was flying at the crossover speed of 190 knots with flaps 1, using the stick would not correct the situation. When the right rudder was applied the rudder went to its fullblown left position causing the plane to roll further left, stall and go into a dive. Some speculate if the pilot-in-command pushed forward on the yoke to gain some speed rather than pull back, the accident possibly could have been avoided. Blame was not placed on the crew because there was no mention of this type of recovery by the manufacturer nor was there any training for such an occurrence.,The aircraft few into the side of a hill during heavy rain, high winds and severe turbulence.,Just as the plane took off there was a pitch-up and stall resulting in the plane crashing into the water. The down elevator control cable failed at station 367 due to corrosion. The failure resulted from salt water induced corrosion.

On the second takeoff the tail struck the ground and crashed back to the ground. The loss of directional control by the pilot in command during the takeoff roll, and his decision to continue the takeoff and initiate a rotation below the computed rotation airspeed, resulting in a premature lift-off, further loss of control and collision with the terrain. The flight crew\\'s lack of understanding of the three-engine takeoff procedures, and their decision to modify those procedures. The failure of the company to ensure that the flight crew had adequate experience, training, and rest to conduct the nonroutine flight. Contributing to the accident was the inadequacy of Federal Aviation Administration oversight of Air Transport International and Federal Aviation Administration flight and duty time regulations that permitted a substantially reduced flight crew rest period when conducting a nonrevenue ferry flight under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.,The cargo plane crashed into a mountain while on approach. The pilot\\'s failure to comply with published instrument approach procedures by a premature descent below the minimum altitude specified for the approach.,Crashed into trees in a residential neighborhood after experiencing an engine failure while taking off..,Shortly after takeoff in poor visibility and heavy snow, with autothrottles engaged, climb thrust was selected. The right engine throttle jammed and remained at takeoff thrust, while the left engine throttle slowly reduced to idle. The increasing thrust asymmetry resulted in an increasing left bank angle, which eventually reached about 170 degrees. The airplane lost altitude and impacted the ground.

The aircraft hit trees, crashed into a field and burned while trying to make an emergency landing at West Georgia Regional Airport. The in-flight fatigue fracture and separation of a propeller blade resulting in distortion of the left engine nacelle, causing excessive drag, loss of wing lift, and reduced directional control of the airplane. The fracture was caused by a fatigue crack from multiple corrosion pits that were not discovered by Hamilton Standard because of inadequate and ineffective corporate inspection and repair techniques, training, documentation and communication. Two died of their injuries after the accident.,While en route the cargo plane flew into a 4,800 ft. mountain. The pilot\\'s continued VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions. The weather was a factor.,After climbing to 18,400\\' msl, the pilot reported a turbocharger problem & reversed course. He said he \\'may lose the left engine\\' & that he was unable to maintain altitude. He diverted to an alternate airport. During a right turn onto final approach, the airplane was observed to cross (overshoot) the extended centerline of the runway. It continued in a right turn back toward the centerline, and then entered a left turn to intercept the inbound course. The turn steepened, and then the airplane entered a spin & crashed 1/2 mile short of the runway. Failure of the pilot to maintain adequate airspeed, while maneuvering on approach, which resulted in an inadvertent stall/spin and uncontrolled collision with terrain. Factors relating to the accident were: the pilot allowed the aircraft weight and balance limitations to be exceeded; the pilot\\'s lack of recurrent training in the make and model of airplane; inadequate maintenance/inspection of the engine exhaust systems; a warped and leaking exhaust system flange on the left engine, which resulted in a loss of power in that engine; and the pilot\\'s improper use of the flaps.,Crashed short of the runway in rain, fog and reduced visibility after diverting from another airport and two landing attempts.,The pilot reported an instrument problem after taking off from Ratmalana Airport and was returning for an emergency landing when the plane fell from 8,000 feet and crashed into the sea.,The intended destination was Mores Cay, but one of the survivors stated the pilot could not find the island and diverted to Marsh Harbour.,Following a visual approach, the aircraft landed long and fast and overran the end of the runway into a shanty town while attempting a go-around.,Struck a tree and crashed while attempting to land.

Aboard were members of a  Dutch Army Band returning from Italy.,While on a flight from New York to Paris, France, the aircraft exploded at  FL 130, broke up and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off Long Island, N.Y. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was an explosion of the center wing fuel tank resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank. The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty but, of the sources evaluated by the investigation, the most likely was a short circuit outside of the center wing tank that allowed excessive voltage to enter it through electrical wiring associated with the fuel quantity indication system.  To say that numerous government agencies acted strangely and suspiciously would be an understatement.  A great deal of evidence was either suppressed or ignored. Rumors persist that the plane was brought down by a missile, either by the Navy conducting exercises in the area or by terrorists.,Crashed 150 ft. short of the runway.,Soon after takeoff, the No. 3 engine caught fire in the cargo plane. The pilot tried to return to the airport for an emergency landing but the right wing seperated and the plane crashed. Fatigue failure of the master connecting rod, which originated from corrosion pitting, subsequently compromised the engine crankcase, and resulted in a fire; and failure of the flight crew to follow emergency procedures by pulling the fire handle before feathering the propeller, which diminished the effectiveness of the fire suppression system.,After touching down, the cargo plane bounced twice and continued to the end of the runway, became airborne but crashed terrain. For unknown reasons, a decision was made to overshoot even though insufficient runway remained for acceleration, take-off, and climb. Likely contributing directly to the decision to overshoot was the difficulty in controlling the aircraft on touchdown.,The plane struck a mountain. Failure of the crew to monitor the aircraft\\'s position and flight path relative to high terrain surrounding Jackson Hole Airport.,While en route, flew into the side of a mountain. The pilot probably made a navigational error because of restricted visibility in fog and light drizzle and entered the wrong valley, and he delayed his decision to reverse course until he was unable to avoid the weather.,After taking off from Belgrade, the plane experienced electrical problems and returned to the airport. After dumping fuel and circling for 3 hours, the plane crashed into a corn field 800m short of the runway.,The aircraft crashed 7 nm short of the runway into Operafjellet Mountain at an altitude of 2,900 ft. while attempting to land in poor weather. The crew did not use the usual approach which includes a turn over the ocean, but rather took a route that led through a narrow valley. Inadequate planning, unsatisfactory crew resource management and monitoring, not discontinuing the approach when procedural uncertainties existed and limited knowledge of the operating language and the actual airspace. The passengers were mainly Russian coal miners headed for a Russian mine on one of the Norwegian islands.,After taking off, the aircraft stopped climbing, struck a pole and crashed and burn. Improper installation of a connecting bolt in the throttle linkage, which resulted in a worn/disconnected throttle arm, partial loss of engine power, and a forced landing after takeoff.,Shortly after takeoff from Texel, a connecting rod bearing in the No.1 engine failed. The prop was feathered.  Soon after, a part of the feathering mechanism failed and the prop started windmilling causing drag. The aircraft rapidly descended and crashed onto a mud-flat.

He later informed ATC he could not feather the propeller. The  aircraft subsequently crashed and burned in a field.  The accident was due to inappropriate management of the flight following jamming of the propeller in an intermediate position after the right engine crankshaft ruptured. The inappropriate management was due to the pilot’s relative lack of experience on this aircraft type, his false notions about the aircraft’s performance and about the existence of a flight level to maintain level flight with an unfeathered propeller and an heavy aircraft and a series of misjudged strategies to attempt to continue the flight then to land at Limoges when the aircraft’s altitude no longer made this possible.,The plane crashed mid-way along its scheduled 50 minute route. The aircraft went into a roll and lost control after taking evasive action to avoid another aircraft. The plane was flying almost at the speed of sound when it crashed and disintegrated. ATC error. The controller thought he had cleared to aircraft to FL100 but the aircraft was still flying at FL240.,Midair collision 17 km W of New Delhi.  The Saudi 747 had just taken off from New Delhi airport ascending to 14,000 feet while the Il-76 was descending. Three hundred twelve aboard the B-747 and thirty-seven aboard the Il-76 were killed. The Il-76 descended below its assigned altitude. The death toll was reduced from 351 to 349 after Kazakstan Airlines reported 37 aboard rather than 39. Neither aircraft was equipped with an Airborne Collision Avoidance System. The 747 had taken off from Delhi and had been cleared to climb to FL140.  Meanwhile, the IL76, which was inbound to Delhi on the same airway, had been cleared to descend to FL150. However, due to a misunderstanding, the pilot and most of the cockpit crew of the IL76 believed the flight had been cleared to continue down to FL140. The Indian accident report attributed the failure of most of the IL76 crew to correctly understand the situation due to their lack of a working knowledge of English. Also contributing to the crew\\'s decision to continue the descent below their clearance limit were poor cockpit resource management, a lack of leadership by the captain, a lack of co-ordination between the crew and a general casual attitude to the conduct of the flight.,Lost altitude and crashed while en route in poor weather. Stall of the left wing due to icing.,While landing on Runway 13 at Baldwin Field, the United Express collided with the King Air which was taking off on Runway 4. The collision took place where the two runways intersect. Both planes caught fire and rescuers were unable to open the door to the Beech 1900-C because of impact damage.

The crew reported losing an engine, followed by complete electrical failure.,The aircraft was hijacked shortly after taking off from Ethiopia by three drunken escaped prisoners. They demanded to be flown to Australia, but wouldn\\'t let the pilot stop to refuel. The plane eventually ran out of fuel and ditched 500 feet offshore of Le Galawa Beach on the island of Grand Comoros. When it was aparent the plane was out of fuel, the hijackers fought the pilot for control of the aircraft. In the last seconds aloft, the left wing tip struck the water and the plane crashed into the sea flipping at least once before breaking into several  parts. The water was shallow but many passengers had inflated their safety vests which prevented them from swimming out from under the cabin and they drowned.,Shortly after taking off the cargo plane turn back toward the airport, increased it\\'s bank angle until the aircraft hit the ground.

They attempted to return for an emergency landing but the cargo plane crashed right wing low, cartwheeled and burst into flames short of the runway. A fire within the right engine compartment of undetermined cause and the pilot-in-command\\'s failure to maintain airspeed above the aircraft\\'s minimum control speed. A factor contributing to the accident was the dark night environmental conditions,The cargo plane crashed short of the runway while attempting to land.,The cargo plane struck mountainous terrain after experiencing a stall during tests. The inappropriate control inputs applied by the flying pilot during a stall recovery attempt, the failure of the non-flying pilot-in-command to recognize, address and correct these inappropriate control inputs, and the failure of Airborne Express to establish a formal, functional evaluation flight program that included adequate program guidelines, requirements and pilot training for performance of these flights. Contributing to the cause of the accident were the inoperative stick shaker stall warning system and Airborne Express DC-8 flight training simulator\\'s inadequate fidelity in reproducing the airplane\\'s stall characteristics.,Crashed while en route after the pilot reported an engine fire. Undetected cracks in the engine not detected during routine maintenance.,The cargo plane was on a positioning flight when it struck rising terrain while making an approach to land. The captain\\'s failure to maintain situational awareness, which resulted in the airplane being outside the confines of the instrument approach; and the crew\\'s misinterpretation of a step-down fix passage, which resulted in an early descent into rising terrain. Factors included the captain\\'s misreading of the instrument approach procedure, the crew\\'s rushed and incomplete instrument approach briefing, their failure to use additional, available navigational aids, and their failure to account for the winds at altitude.,While on approach the plane struck power lines and came to rest in shallow water. The pilot\\'s continued VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions. Factors in this accident were; fog, the low ceiling, and the dark night.,Crashed onto a mountin in high winds and rain after being diverted from another airport.,While on approach and attempting to land on runway 3R at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, in a snowstorm, the aircraft went into a steep dive and crashed into a field. The accident was caused by the FAA\\'s failure to establish adequate aircraft certification standards for flight in icing conditions.  Contributing to the accident were the flightcrew\\'s decision to operate in icing conditions near the lower margin of the operating airspeed envelope (with flaps retracted), and Comair\\'s failure to establish and adequately disseminate unambiguous minimum airspeed values for flap configurations and for flight in icing conditions. In addition, Embraer\\'s manual for the aircraft specified correctly that the deicing boots should be activated as soon as icing occured.  But the pilots were trained by Comair\\'s manual, which specified waiting until ice was about 1/2 inch thick.,While en rote the plane experienced engine trouble. The crew decided to divert to Sparrevohn. While attempting to land the plane encountered strong turbulence from surrounding mountains. Although full power was applied to the good engine the plane crashed into terrain. Loss of the right engine propeller control oil, which led to an overspeed of the right engine and propeller, and necessitated a shut-down of the right engine; and failure of the pilot to maintain adequate altitude/distance from terrain during visual approach for a precautionary landing at an alternate airport. Factors relating to the accident were: fluctuation of the left engine power, premature lowering of the airplane flaps, and an encounter with adverse weather conditions (including high winds, severe turbulence, and white-out conditions) during the approach.,The aircraft crashed shortly after taking off fromTambacoumba after losing power in the left engine.

Won Guam International Airport. The runway glide slope system was inoperative. In addition, the Minimum Safe Altitude Warning system (MSAW) was also not working due to a software problem. The captain’s failure to adequately brief and execute the non-precision approach and the first officer\\'s and flight engineer\\'s failure to effectively monitor and cross-check the captain’s execution of the approach. Contributing to these failures were the captain\\'s fatigue and Korean Air\\'s  inadequate flight crew training. Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration\\'s (FAA) intentional inhibition of the MSAW at Guam and the agency\\'s failure to adequately manage the system.,Immediately after taking off the plane went into a nose-high attitude, stalled and crashed to the ground. The probable cause of the accident, which resulted from the airplane being misloaded to produce a more aft center of gravity and a correspondingly incorrect stabilizer trim setting that precipitated an extreme pitch-up at rotation, was (1) the failure of Fine Air to exercise operational control over the cargo loading process and  (2) the failure of Aeromar to load the airplane as specified by Fine Air. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the FAA to adequately monitor Fine Airs operational control responsibilities for cargo loading and the failure of the FAA to ensure that known cargo-related deficiencies were corrected at Fine Air.,The aircraft flew into a mountain and exploded in flames after a missed approach and while executing a go-around in rain and high winds. The pilot turned right instead of left when initiating the go-around.,French Canadian actress Marie-Soleil Tougas, 27, and  film director Jean-Claude Lauzon, 43, were killed when their Cessna crashed into a mountainside in strong winds and rain.

Shortly after taking off a fourth time, witnesses heard the engine make popping noises, bank to the right, pitch up, and go into a steep dive from about a  500 foot altitude and crash into the sea about 150 yards offshore. Singer John Denver, 53, who was piloting the plane, was killed. Denver, an experienced pilot with over 2,800 flying hours, had only a little over an hour in the experimental plane. The accident was caused by the inadvertent application of right rudder by the pilot as he attempted to manipulate the fuel selector handle. The unmarked fuel selector handle in this aircraft was located in a hard to reach area behind the pilot\\'s left shoulder, instead of between his legs. This required removing his harness and reaching behind. While turning around, he inadvertently pressed down on the plane\\'s right rudder pedal causing the aircraft to roll and go into a dive.  Contributing factors were, Denver took off with too little fuel in one tank which led to the necessity of switching to his backup tank. Also it was difficult to determine how much fuel was in the tanks due to the unmarked fuel quantity sight gauge.,A few minutes after takeoff a distress call was received from the aircraft after which it ditched into the sea 200 yards offshore. The pilot\\'s disregard for lateral fuel loading limits, his improper removal of frost prior to takeoff, and the resulting inadvertent stall/spin. Factors involved in this accident were the improper asymmetrical fuel loading which reduced lateral aircraft control, the self-induced pressure to takeoff on time by the pilot, and inadequate surveillance of the company operations by company management.,The military aircraft, bound for Vladivostok, crashed into a residential neighborhood twenty seconds after taking off. All four engines failed after the computer system began shutting them down shortly after takeoff.  Design flaw which led to uncoordinated operation of the high-pressure compressors.,Crashed during the second approach right of the approach path. While the aircraft was being manoeuvred at a very low level in marginal weather, it descended after an abrupt turn and flew, in controlled flight, into the terrain. Crew procedural error. The aircraft was 1,000 pounds heavier than the maximum allowable weight.

The cause of the accident is undetermined, however, it is probable that low-level, visual flight in deteriorating weather contributed to the accident.,The aircraft crashed into Mt. Olympus while approaching Salonica, during a second attempt to land. The plane was holding at 3,300 feet due to heavy traffic. Tower tapes indicate that after the missed approach, the crew reported they were heading north when they actually were heading west. An investigation revealed the crew had poor training, flew too low, didn\\'t know how to use the radar equipment and failed to declare an emergency after they missed the landing strip. A second crash occurred when a C-130 transport plane on its way to pick up troops to assist in the search, crashed into Pastra Mountain.,The plane disappeared off radar screens and shortly after, crashed into the Musi River. The plane, almost brand-new, cruising in good weather and with an experienced crew, suddenly left normal flight from 35,000 feet and crashed at a high rate of speed into the Sumatran jungle. The right wing and parts of the rudder separated from the aircraft before it crashed. The Indonesian National Transportation Committee found that there was insufficient evidence to find a cause for the accident. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board strongly disagreed and stated the jet\\'s cockpit voice recorder was intentionally disconnected and its flight controls placed in a nose-down position most likely by the captain. While the U.S. NTSB stopped short of using the term suicide, its dissenting report made it clear it believed the crash was the result of actions by the captain. In July 2004 a California jury found the manufacturer of the PCU valve that controls rudder responsible for the accident after the valve was located and showed defects which may have led to a rudder hardover.,Two hours into the flight, at FL 310, the plane received reports of severe clear air turbulence in the area and the seat belt sign was turned on.

The crew then advised ATC that the left engine had been shut down because it was on fire. The crew decided to proceed to Mirabel International Airport. Then crew then advised ATC that the engine fire was out. On final for Runway 24, the crew advised ATC that the left engine was again on fire. The landing gear was extended on short final, and when the aircraft was over the runway, the left wing broke upwards. The fuselage inverted, struck the runway and slid 2,500 feet and came to rest on the left side of the runway.  PC: The crew did not realize that the pull to the left and the extended take-off run were due to the left brakes\\' dragging, which led to overheating of the brake components. The dragging caused overheating and leakage, probably at one of the piston seals that retain the brake hydraulic fluid. When hydraulic fluid leaked onto the hot brake components, the fluid caught fire and initiated an intense fire in the left nacelle, leading to failure of the main hydraulic system. When the L WING OVHT light went out, the overheating problem appeared corrected; however, the fire continued to burn. The crew never realized that all of the problems were associated with a fire in the wheel well, and they did not realize how serious the situation was. The left wing was weakened by the wing/engine fire and failed, rendering the aircraft uncontrollable.,The helicopter impacted a mountain on a sightseeing trip. The pilot\\'s decision to continue VFR flight into deteriorating weather conditions consisting of lowering ceilings and visibility in mountainous terrain, which resulted in the inadvertent entry into instrument meteorological conditions and a collision with a mountainside.

The Beechcraft was on a flight from Lyon to Lorient, approaching Lorient, when it requested permission to fly over the ocean liner Norway. While circling the Norway, it collided with the Cessna. One killed aboard the Cessna, 14 aboard the Beechcraft.  The pilots of the Beechcraft decided to deviate from their course in order to give passengers a view of the ocean liner Le France. This is unusual but not forbidden. They also descended to 2,000 feet, below the level of radar detection. Both planes approached each other within blind spots. Failure of both pilots to \"see and avoid\" each other under VFR conditions.,Shortly after taking off the plane pitched up, stalled and crashed to the ground. The  pitch-up was caused by an uncommanded downward movement of the horizontal stabilizer. This was due to a partial detachment of the actuator forward bearing support fitting due to the non-installation of required hi-lok fasteners.,The pilot made three low passes over the water in an attempt to land at Kincolith. On the fourth approach, the aircraft touched down, apparently in a controlled manner, and skipped on the water surface. The floats then dug into the water followed by the right wing, which was severed from the fuselage on water impact. The aircraft quickly overturned and came to rest inverted with only the bottom of the floats visible. All five occupants drowned. On touchdown, the floats struck the water and caused a flying attitude that the pilot could not control before the right wing dug in and the aircraft overturned. Contributing to the accident were conflicting wind and water conditions at the time of the occurrence.,While en route, the aircraft experienced double engine failure. The plane ditched into Foveaux Strait. Five passengers were rescued, but four passengers and the pilot did not have lifejackets and did not survive. The double engine failure was possibly related to fuel management.,The aircraft crashed in a remote mountainous area at an elevation of 12,000 feet while on a flight from Jomsom to Potokari.

This resulted in the nose of the aircraft pitching up after rotation, causing the pilot to lose control of the aircraft.,The aircraft crashed and burned during takeoff from Quito. The crew tried and failed twice to take off. On the third attempt, the plane struggled to gain altitude, rising a few feet, but settled back to earth plowing past the end of the runway and crashing into an auto body shop and coming to rest in a soccer field. The accident was caused by the late decision of the crew to abort the takeoff.,The aircraft was on a flight from JFK Airport, New York to Geneva, Switzerland when the crew reported smoke in the cockpit and requested an emergency landing at Halifax. The plane began dumping fuel and preparing for an emergency landing when it disappeared from radar and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean southwest of Halifax. A fire in the entertainment system wiring started in a hidden area above the cockpit ceiling when arcing ignited the cover material made of thermal insulation blankets. This set off an in-flight fire that spread and increased in intensity until it led to the loss of the aircraft.. It was determined that  aircraft certification standards for material flammability at the time of the accident were inadequate. Dr. Jonathan Mann, researcher in the fight against AIDS and Joseph LaMotta, son of boxing champion Jake LaMotta, killed in the crash.,The plane crashed while attempting to cross a mountain pass, following two other company airplanes in conditions described as five to seven miles visibility, 700 feet ceilings, clouds hanging on the mountainsides, and misty rain. The pilot\\'s failure to maintain adequate airspeed which resulted in an inadvertent stall. Unfamiliarity with the geographic area, the low clouds, his becoming disoriented, and the blind canyon into which he flew. The audible stall warning circuit breaker was found in the pulled (disabled) position.,The aircraft hit the face of  mountain. The aircraft probably encountered a strong laminar downdraught before entering a thin cloud layer before impact.

The crew descended the aircraft well below safe minimum altitude while in instrument meteorological conditions and without having established any visual contact with the runway environment.,While making a landing in strong winds and rain, the pilot-in-command disconnected the autopilot but left the autothrottle engaged. The aircraft, with a weight close to the maximum landing weight permitted, stabilized slightly low on the glideslope. An attempt was made to flare but the aircraft landed hard on its right landing gear and the No.3 engine touched the runway. The right main landing gear and right wing separated. The MD-11 then inverted and skidded off the runway in flames. Probable Cause: The commander\\'s unability to arrest the high rate of descent existing at 50 ft. RA. Contributory Causes:  The commander\\'s failure to appreciate the combination of a reducing airspeed, increasing rate of descent, and with the thrust decreasing to flight idle.\\nThe commander\\'s failure to apply power to counteract the high rate of descent prior to touchdown. Probable variations in wind direction and speed below 50 ft RA may have resulted in a momentary loss of headwind component and, in combination with the early retardation of the thrust levers, and at a weight only just below the maximum landing weight, led to a 20 kt loss in indicated airspeed just prior to touchdown. A possible contributory cause may have been a reduction in peripheral vision as the aircraft entered the area of the landing flare, resulting in the commander not appreciating the high rate of descent prior to touchdown.,A fire in the front portion of the cabin, in the overhead luggage compartment, caused thick black smoke to accumulate in the cabin.  Accidental ignition of gas taken aboard in 2 bleach and softner bottles, stored in a overhead locker.,The aircraft struck power lines 2,000m past the end of the runway after a second attempted go-around.,While attempting to take off from Jorge Newberry airport, the crew aborted takeoff, overran the runway, skidded across a service road and crashed into several cars and into a golf course, bursting into flames.

Witnesses said the plane was flying very low before they saw the plane crash into Mount Esperanca on the island of Sao Jorge.,While attempting to land at La Aurora International Airport, the aircraft overshot the runway, rolled down an embankment and crashed into houses in the La Libertad section of the city. Witnesses say the plane was unable to stop after it began its landing too far down the runway. The crew failed to initiate a go-around after overshooting on a wet runway with insufficient deceleration to make a safe stop. Leased from AOM.,Shortly after taking off the ADI comparator alarm sounded three times. Shortly afterwards, the warning sounded a further two times. As the captain initiated a procedural turn to the left, the comparator warning sounded 9 more times.. The aircraft then banked left progressively and entered a descent until it struck the ground in a 40 degree nose down attitude at a high rate of speed. The pilots did not respond appropriately to the comparator warnings during the climb after takeoff from Stansted despite prompts from the flight engineer. The commander, as the handling pilot, maintained a left roll control input, rolling the aircraft to approximately 90 of left bank and there was no control input to correct the pitch attitude throughout the turn. The first officer either did not monitor the aircraft attitude during the climbing turn or, having done so, did not alert the commander to the extreme unsafe attitude that developed.,While on approach, after circling for 40 minutes and 5 miles from Valencia Airport,  the aircraft crashed into the Tocuyito mountain range and exploded in flames. The airport at Valencia was being used as operations at Simon Bolivar International Airport, Caracas had been disrupted by flooding in the region.,The aircraft crashed 5 minutes after taking off from Simara.  The aircraft was observed not following the usual route into the mountains.,The aircraft crashed shortly after taking off, 8 km from the airport in light rain. After departing, the captain turned the aircraft to the right instead of to the left. The first officer advised the captain he should be turning right and ATC also asked about the direction taken. ATC then cleared the aircraft for a right turn. Soon after, the pitch decreased rapidly accompanied by a marked speed increase and plane entered a high speed, high-rate, spiral descent and crashed into an open field. The flight crew reacted inappropriately to the change in departure clearance SID ZUE 1Y by ATC. The first officer made an entry in the FMS, without being instructed to do so by the commander, which related to the change to the SID ZUE 1 standard instrument departure. In doing so, he omitted to select a turn direction. The captain dispensed with use of the autopilot under instrument flight conditions and during the work-intensive climb phase of the flight. The captain took the aircraft into a spiral dive to the right because, with a probability bordering on certainty, he had lost spatial orientation. The first officer took only inadequate measures to prevent or recover from the spiral dive.,The aircraft was on a flight from Tripoli to Marsa el-Brega Libya ferrying oil workers. As the twin engine plane approached Marsa El-Brega, the crew experienced a double engine failure and ditched into the sea. Failure of the crew to use the anti-icing system which led to the ingestion of melting ice into both engines causing failure of both engines.,The aircraft was not able to maintain altitude after taking off and crashed into a house.

A few seconds after lifting off the ground the stall warning sounded and continued for about 20 seconds until it was manually turned off by the crew. Three seconds later the plane impacted the water. The pilot\\'s response to an alarm that inaccurately indicated the plane had stalled. The pilot failed to complete established procedure for such an emergency. Takeoff conditions also contributed to the accident, which occurred at night, hampering the crew\\'s ability to judge the plane\\'s distance from the sea.,The aircraft crashed into the Pacific Ocean south of Point Mugu in 650 ft. feet of water while en route from Puerto Vallarta to San Francisco. Radio transmissions from the plane indicated the pilots were struggling with a jammed stabilizer for the last 11 minutes of the flight before nose-diving into the sea. While preparing to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport control was lost and the MD-83 was seen in a nose-down attitude, spinning and tumbling in a continuous roll, inverted, before it impacted the sea.  Loss of airplane pitch control resulting from in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assembly\\'s acme nut thread. The component failed because of excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines\\' insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska Airlines\\' extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation Administration\\'s approval of that extension, which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads and Alaska Airlines\\' extended end play check interval and the FAA\\'s approval of that extension, which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophic effects of total acme nut thread loss. Cynthia Oti, radio financial talk show host, Dean Forshee, guitarist, Jean Gandesberry, columnist, Tom Stockley, columnist were among those killed.,The airplane impacted level terrain, covered by smooth, wind-blown, snow, in a left bank of 26 degrees or greater.

Factors associated with the accident were snow, rain, and whiteout conditions.,The cargo plane lost altitude after taking off and crashed into a auto salvage yard and burned. A loss of pitch control resulting from the disconnection of the right elevator control tab. The disconnection was caused by the failure to properly secure and inspect the attachment bolt.,While attempting to land at Burbank Airport, the plane overran the runway, collided with a metal blast fence and an airport perimeter wall and came to rest on a city street near a gas station. The plane touched down at 182 knots, 2,150 feet past the runway threshold, too fast and too far down the runway for the plane to stop in time.  In the accident sequence,  the nose gear collapsed, the forward service door (1R) escape slide inflated inside the airplane and  the forward dual flight attendant jumpseat, which was occupied by two flight attendants, partially collapsed. Two passengers sustained serious injuries and 41 passengers and the captain sustained minor injuries. The flightcrew\\'s excessive airspeed and flight path angle during the approach and landing and its failure to abort the approach when stabilized approach criteria were not met. Contributing to the accident was the controller\\'s positioning of the airplane in such a manner as to leave no safe options for the flightcrew other than a go-around maneuver.,The aircraft climbed to an altitude of about 100 ft., stalled, lost control and crashed. Ice build up on the wings. Flaps incorrectly set.,Crashed into a jungle mountainside 15 miles short of its destination while en route.

Factors in this accident were: improper planning of the approach, and not obtaining the proper alignment with the runway.,The aircraft circled Davao airport in an attempt to land but crashed onto a coconut plantation on the mountainous Samal Island. The plane aborted a previous landing attempt because another plane was on the runway. Weather and visibility were good in the area but the landing attempt may have been hampered by low-lying clouds. The last message from the crew was that they were 7 miles from the airport on final approach. Nothing more was heard from the plane. The aircraft disintegrated upon impact near Mt. Kalangan. The elevation of the accident site was about 500 feet above sea level but the plane should have been at a altitude of 1,500 feet.,During a landing attempt the crew shut down No. 1 engine and declared an emergency. The plane was told to divert to Lyon Satolas. Power was applied to the remaining engine and the plane banked to the left causing the wing to touch the ground, crash and catch fire. Loss of yaw and roll control which appears to be due to the failure to monitor flight symmetry at the time of the thrust increase on the right engine.,While on approach the charter flight hit the ridge of a mountain. Inadequate crew coordination led to the captain\\'s decision to discontinue the instrument approach procedure and initiate a maneuvering descent solely by visual references at night in an area of mountainous terrain. The crew failed to review the instrument approach procedure and the copilot failed to provide accurate information regarding terrain clearance and let down procedures during the instrument approach.,The charter flight crashed while on approach in fog and mist.,The plane crashed into a heavily wood area  as it was making a second approach to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport. Visibility was poor in wind, low clouds and light rain.  While attempting the second approach, the pilot reported both engines had quit but restarted one of them before the plane crashed. Investigation revealed indications of rotation on the left engine at the time of impact but the power level was not known. The right engine and propellers exhibited little or no rotation at the time of impact. Failure of the crew to ensure an adequate supply of fuel for the flight, which led to the stoppage of the right engine due to fuel exhaustion and the intermittent stoppage of the left engine.  Failure of the crew to monitor the plane\\'s fuel state and the flightcrews failure to maintain directional control after the initial stoppage.,Midair collision with a MD-83 after taxing on the runway.,En route and descending at Whyalla,  at 6,000 ft., the pilot transmitted a MAYDAY, reporting that both engines of the aircraft had failed, that there were eight persons on board and that he was going to have to ditch the aircraft, but was trying to reach Whyalla. Three minutes later he reported his position 15 nm off the coast of Whyalla. No further transmissions were heard from the plane and the wreckage was found in Spencer Gulf the next morning.

There was fog and rain in the area  at the time.  Flying VFR, deviation to avoid weather resulted in spatial disorientation of the crew which led to descending below a safe flying altitude to clear high ground.,The cargo plane had 19 people aboard when it crashed into a farm after losing the No. 2 engine, two minutes after taking off from Villavicencio.,The plane, on a positioning flight crashed into rugged woods during an approach to land. The pilot\\'s continued VFR flight into IMC conditions, by failing to maintain altitude, and descending from VFR conditions into IMC, which resulted in him subsequently impacting with trees. Factors in this accident were: reduced visibility due to dark night and fog. An additional factor was the pilot was not certified for instrument flight.,While attempting to land at Patna, the aircraft was too high and the crew attempted a go-around. During the second landing attempt, the aircraft was again high, veered to left and lost altitude until it crashed into houses in the Gardanibagh district and burst into flames. The cause of the accident was loss of control of the aircraft due to crew error. The crew did not followed the correct approach procedure, which resulted in the aircraft being high on approach. The crew then initiated a \"go-around procedure\" instead of an \"approach to stall recovery procedure\" resulting in an actual stall of the aircraft, loss of control and subsequent impact with the ground.,After declaring an emergency the cargo plane crew requested the nearest airport. The aircraft soon after descended out of control and crashed on the eastern side of the Meduxnekeag River. The pilot-in-command\\'s failure to maintain minimum control airspeed, which resulted in a loss of control. Factors in this accident were clouds, and a loss of engine power for undetermined reasons, while in cruise flight above the airplane\\'s single engine service ceiling.,The cargo plane lost an engine on takeoff lost altitude and crashed 2 miles east of the airport.,The helicopter, on a sightseeing tour, crashed into mountains on the western slopes of Maui at an elevation of 2,850 feet inclement weather.,The aircraft struggled to gain altitude after taking off from Charles de Gaulle airport. The pilot reported the No. 2 engine failed and struggled to steer towards Le Bourget airfield as smoke and fire trailed the jet\\'s left wing.   The plane was unable to gain altitude, went nose high, stalled and crashed into a small hotel complex.  A metal strip left on the runway by another plane gashed one of the Concorde\\'s tires which blew out sending a piece of rubber into the underside of the wing which sent a shockwave which ruptured a seam in the fuel tank. An electrical severed by another piece of rubber sparked which ignited leaking fuel ignited and started an uncontrollable fire. Power was lost to the No. 1 and No. 2 engines which led to loss of control of the aircraft and subsequent crash. Investigation revealed the metal strip was probably a thrust reverser part from Continental Airlines DC-10-30 , registered N13067 which departed Paris as Flight 055 to Newark. This is the first crash of a Concorde in aviation history. The French government convicted Continental and a Continental mechanic of a crime but an appeals court reversed the decision.,The aircraft crashed into the Churia mountain range at 4,300 ft., 20 minutes into a 30 minute flight to Dhangadhi in rain and fog.,The helicopter exploded and crashed from a height of 1,000 ft.,The aircraft crashed into a volcano after the pilot reported he was diverting to Puerto Montt because of ice formation on the wings. The wreckage was found 15 days later.,The two aircraft collided over a central New Jersey subdivision, scattering debris over a wide area. The Navajo had taken off from Lakehurst Naval Air Station and the Seminole from Northeast Philadelphia Airport.  The Navajo crashed into a two-story house while the Seminole fell into a soybean field. Two pilots and seven passenger were killed on the Navajo as were a pilot instructor and his student on the Seminole. Failure of the pilots of the two airplanes to see and avoid each other and maintain proper airspace separation during visual flight rules.,The float plane took off, entered a steep climb, stalled and crashed into the water. The pilot\\'s decision to depart from the unlit location was likely the result of the many psychological and physiological stressors encountered during the day. The pilot most likely experienced spatial disorientation precipitated by local geographic and environmental conditions and lost control of the aircraft.,While on approach the airplane collided with trees and the ground and subsequently burst into flames.  Pilot\\'s failure to follow instrument procedures and descended below approach minimums and collided with trees.,The aircraft crashed into the Persian Gulf and exploded in flames while attempting to land at Bahrain International Airport. The crew decided to perform a missed approach after it was determined the aircraft was coming in too high and fast. Instructions were given for a 180 degree turn and climb to 2,500 feet. While performing the missed approach the plane suddenly descended rapidly from an altitude of 1,000 feet and crashed into the shallow waters of the gulf approximately 1 mile from the airport. The accident was a result of a fatal combination of factors, including the captain\\'s failure to comply with standard operating procedures and the copilot\\'s actions in not drawing the captain\\'s attention to the deviations of the aircraft from the standard flight parameters. The captain may have suffered a \"spatial disorientation\" to ground warning systems, which could have made him falsely perceive the aircraft was pitching up. He responded by making a nose down input, resulting in the aircraft starting to descend, when aircraft warning systems were saying he should increase altitude.,The aircraft, was on an around-the-island tour when it\\'s right engine caught fire. While attempting an emergency landing at Hilo International Airport, the plane ditched into Hilo Bay. Eight people escaped from the plane before it sank in 100 feet of water. One passenger was not able to exit the plane and drowned. Possible failure of the turbo unit on the right engine.,The plane crashed head-on into 5,360 ft. Arenal volcano, 95 miles north of San Jose shortly after taking off from La Fortuna. The pilot was flying VFR and deviated from his course by 12 miles, most likely to give passengers a view of the volcano which had erupted earlier in the week. The reason the crew did not see the volcano is not known. Possibly, with changing meteorological conditions in the area, the volcano may have been obscured by clouds. The plane, built in 1998, had been leased from Aeroperlas.,Shortly after departing Perth and after the aircraft had climbed through its assigned altitude, the pilot’s speech became significantly impaired and he appeared unable to respond to ATS instructions. Open microphone transmissions over the next 8-minutes revealed the progressive deterioration of the pilot towards unconsciousness and the absence of any sounds of passenger activity in the aircraft. No human response of any kind was detected for the remainder of the flight. Five hours after taking off from Perth, the aircraft impacted the ground 65 km ESE of Burketown, Queensland, and was destroyed. Incapacitation of the pilot and passengers a result of hypobaric hypoxia due to the aircraft being fully or partially unpressurised and their not receiving supplemental oxygen. The investigation could not determine the reason for the aircraft being unpressurised, or why the pilot and passengers did not receive supplemental oxygen.,The Air Force helicopter was on a domestic flight when it cashed into mountainous terrain 75 km from Colombo. The helicopter’s pilot had contacted air traffic controllers saying he had problems with visibility and was lowering his altitude. Sri Lanka, Muslim Congress leader M. H. M. Ashraff, 52, along with members of his entourage were killed.,The belly cargo pod  lightly scraped the runway for about 40 feet, but the airplane transitioned to a climb. As the airplane began climbing away from the runway, the landing gear was observed to extend. The airplane climbed to about 100 to 150 feet above the ground, and then began a descending left turn. The airplane collided with the ground on a 95 degree heading. The wreckage path extended for about 300 feet, during which the landing gear, left wing, and the left engine separated from the airplane. A postcrash fire destroyed the fuselage, right wing, and the right engine. The pilot\\'s failure to extend the landing gear, his improper aborted landing procedure, and inadvertent stall/mush. Factors in the accident were an improper adjustment of the landing gear warning horn system by company maintenance personnel, and the failure of the pilot to utilize the prelanding checklist.,The aircraft overshot the runway near Reynosa, Mexico and crashed into vehicles and houses coming to rest in a canal. The accident happened during a heavy rainstorm. The lights at the airport were out due to the storm and contact with the tower was lost. No passengers were killed aboard the aircraft but four people were killed on the ground.,The chartered cargo plane hit tree tops and discintegrated while attempting to land. Although the pilot and the aircraft were certified for instrument flight, the pilot apparently continued to fly in accordance with visual flight rules after encountering marginal weather conditions and reduced visibility. For undetermined reasons, the pilot descended below the elevation of the terrain surrounding the airstrip, resulting in a controlled-flight-into-terrain accident.,After receiving special VFR clearance the cargo plane flew into a small hill. The pilot\\'s attempted flight into known adverse weather conditions, and his subsequent failure to maintain altitude above, or clearance with, trees. Factors contributing to the accident included low ceilings, fog, the pilot\\'s low-altitude flight, rising terrain, and trees.,The cause of this accident was the pilot\\'s excessive takeoff rotation, during an aft center of gravity takeoff, a rearward migration of fuel during acceleration and takeoff and consequent shift in the airplane\\'s aft c.g. to aft of the aft c.g. limit, which caused the airplane to stall at an altitude too low for recovery. Contributing to the accident were Bombardier\\'s inadequate flight planning procedures for the Challenger flight test program and the lack of direct, on-site operational oversight by Transport Canada and the Federal Aviation Administration.,The twin engine Cessna crashed into a densely wooded area, 30 miles south of St. Louis, 25 minutes after taking off from Parks Airport. The plane was flying in rain and fog when the pilot reported he was at 6,500 feet and having problems with the artificial horizon. Radar contact was soon lost with the aircraft.  Witnesses reported hearing a plane in a dive followed by an explosion.  Wreckage was scattered over a wide area.  Mel Carnahan, 66, Governor of Missouri was killed in the accident along with a campaign aide and his son, Roger, who was piloting the plane.,The aircraft crashed into a mountain at 4,800 ft., in poor weather, while making an apporach to Sam Neua.,Communications were lost with the aircraft as it approached Mt. Tirina at 4,250 feet, preparing to land at Batumi. The aircraft was seen rapidly descending into mountainous terrain. A large explosion followed as the plane crashed somewhere between the towns of  Batumi and Kabuleti in heavy rain. Navigation error made by the crew in the final stage of the landing approach. Error by the Batumi ATC who failed to locate the plane and conform it to the crew. Erroneous data shown by ground radio-technical facilities at Batumi airport.,Weather conditions at the time were extremely poor due to typhoon Xiang Sane. A NOTAM issued on Aug 31, 2000 indicated that Runway 05R was closed due to construction between Sep 13 and Nov 22. After reaching the end of Taxiway NP, the plane turned onto Taxiway N1 and then made a 180-degree turn onto Runway 05R and began its takeoff roll. Approximately 3.5 seconds after reaching V1, the aircraft hit construction equipment on the runway, crashed back to the ground, broke up and burst into flames. The pilot attempted to take off from a closed runway. The following factors contributed to the accident. Of three lights used to guide the aircraft onto the correct runway, one was not working and another dim. The airport lacked \"guard lights\" used to help pilots navigate from the taxiway to the correct runway during times of poor visibility. International regulations require that a large white X be placed on the tarmac at the entrance to a closed runway, but there was none at the entrance of runway 5R. Whether there should have been, in this case, however, is itself a contentious matter as the runway remained open for taxiing.,The aircraft exploded in midair 20 minutes after taking off from Saurimo. UNITA rebels claimed they shot down the plane.,During takeoff, the cargo plane struck trees, crashed and caught fire. The indicated failure of the right hand AC bus during takeoff with low ceiling.

Engine failure.,After climbing through 16,000 ft. the crew descovered cabin pressure could not be maintained and returned to the airport.  After landing the ram air switch failed to depressurize the aircraft. Moments later the left foreward door exploded open ejecting a flight attendant onto the tarmac.,During the approach, the plane, on a positioning flight, hit electric lines, then the ground and finally an unoccupied building.,Destabilized approach, attempted to establish runway alignment, insufficient altitude, struck a tree. The aircraft crashed and caught fire.,Crashed into the Great Salt Lake with skydivers during a final approach to Tooele. The pilot\\'s exercise of poor judgment and his failure to maintain a safe altitude/clearance above the water. Contributing factors were the weather conditions that included low ceiling and visibility obscured by snow and mist, an inadequately equipped airplane for flying in instrument meteorological conditions, and the pilot\\'s overconfidence in his personal ability in that he had reportedly done this on two previous occasions.,The cargo plane crashed on Table Top Mountain while en route. The airplane flightcrew\\'s failure to maintain adequate distance/altitude from mountainous terrain during a departure climb to cruise flight, and the captain\\'s impairment from drugs. Factors in the accident were dark night conditions, and the first officer\\'s impairment from drugs.,The plane caught fire shortly after taking off from Ciudad Bolivar where it had made a refueling stop. The pilot was unable to tell the tower what was wrong before rolling inverted and crashing into a neighborhood south of the city.,The plane was on a charter flight from Jefferson County Airport to Stillwater, Oklahoma. Radio and radar contact was lost 20 - 30 minutes after the plane took off as it reached 23,000 feet. The aircraft crashed at a high rate of speed into the ground on a farm 40 miles east of Denver. There was light snow and 1.5 miles visibility at the time of the accident. Two members and six staffers of the Oklahoma State University basketball team were among those killed. The probable cause of this accident was the pilot’s spatial disorientation resulting from his failure to maintain positive manual control of the airplane with the available flight instrumentation.\\nContributing to the cause of the accident was the loss of a.c. electrical power during instrument meteorological conditions.,While attempting to land at Mitú, the cargo plane\\'s landing gear struck the ground short of the threshold. A go- around was executed but the No. 1 engine was shut down because of low oil pressure. The plane flew over the control tower twice to determine the state of the landing gear. It appeared that part of the left main landing gear was missing. The crew then positioned the plane for an approach and landing. As the plane turned into long final, it struck the ground, crashed in a meadow and caught fire.,Impacted trees and crashed while attempting to land. The flightcrew not maintaining altitude/clearance during the circling instrument approach. Factors were the pilot in command initiating the flight without proper weather reporting facilities at the destination, the flightcrew not flying to an alternate destination, the flightcrew not following company and FAA procedures/directives, the lack of certification of the second pilot, the operator not following company and FAA procedures/directives, and the dark night and the low ceiling.,The plane experienced asymetrical thrust during takeoff. Rose 200-300 ft., stalled and crashed into trees. An in-flight failure of the left power plant appromately 3 minutes after take-off and inadequate conduct of the crew  so that in short final the airplane stalled and crashed from low height. The failure of the left engine was caused by intergranular fractures of retention posts on the high pressure turbine disk. As a result of incorrect service life recordings the maximum number of cycles had considerably been exceeded.,Double engine failure on take off cause the cargo plane to ditch in Firth of the Forth estuary. Icing.,The plane was on a flight from Florida to Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia when witnesses observed the plane gliding down and losing altitude until it impacted the ground, exploding into flames. Heavy rain and wind were present in the area at the time of the accident. Weight imbalances in the aircraft were the primary cause of the accident as the cargo shifted when the pilot  got up and walked through the plane toward the rear of the plane, unbalancing the aircraft just as it hit severe turbulence. This led to the loss of control and break-up of the aircraft.,The aircraft exploded and caught fire 35 minutes before its scheduled takeoff. Five members of the cabin crew were the only people aboard the plane at the time. Witnesses said they heard an explosion before flames erupted aboard the aircraft. NTSB investigators reported that the center fuel tank exploded followed by the right tank 18 minutes later. The cause for the explosion was unclear. The center fuel tank is located near air conditioning packs which generate heat, and were running nonstop prior to the explosion.,The aircraft crashed into a mountain at 6,500 ft. while approaching Lubango to land. The weather at the time was cloudy with rain.,The aircraft took off from Prinses Juliana Airport at St. Maarten for a 15 minute flight to St. Jean Airport at St. Barthélémy.

Engine failure.,Crashed while en route.,The aircraft returned to Sentani Airport after experiencing engine trouble, skidded off the runway and struck a fence.,The plane crashed and exploded in flames in Siberian woodlands near the village of Burdakovka, about 21 miles from Irkutsk. The aircraft crashed during the third turn in a landing approach to Irkutsk, an intermediate stop for refueling. The first officer was flying the plane, when at 2,600 ft., an audible alarm sounded indicating a wide angle of attack. Eleven seconds later the aircraft swung around 180 degrees and entered a flat spin. The captain ordered the engines at full throttle but it was too late and 22 seconds later the plane hit the ground, belly first, broke up and burned.\\xa0Incorrect actions of the crew. Due to poor communication between pilots, they put in the wrong parameters while landing causing the plane to descend at the wrong angle. As a result, the plane stalled and entered a spin and crashed.,After several delays in taking off, the helicopter crashed into the sea, just off shore, after striking a electric transmission tower. The accident took place in heavy monsoon rains, poor visibility and high winds. The pilot stated he lost control of the helicopter when it was hit by a sudden gust of wind.,The aircraft crashed and burned moments after taking off from General Bartholomew Salóm Airport during a National Guard demonstration. The right engine appeared to have failed at a critical stage in the takeoff. There were 8 civilians and 5 military personnel board.,The cargo plane was taking off from Chkalovsky Airport with a load of construction material and cosmetics. After reaching a height of 150 feet, the plane the crashed and burned 1,600 feet past the end of the runway.  The plane was overloaded by 15 tones.,The sightseeing plane impacted the side of a mountain in poor visibility. The pilot\\'s continued flight into known adverse weather conditions, and his poor in-flight decision making. Factors associated with the accident were clouds and mountainous terrain. A finding is the pilot\\'s use of FAA prohibited drugs.,The cargo plane crashed into a hill and broke up. Crew did not follow standard operating procedures. Crew fatigue.,The sightseeing helicopter crashed and burned about 3,700 feet up the 5,600-foot Grand Wash Cliffs just outside the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park. The aircraft was returning to McCarran International Airport where it had originated. Besides the pilot, all victims, including the one survivor, were members of the same family. The pilot\\'s decision to maneuver the helicopter in a flight regime and in a high density altitude environment which significantly decreased the helicopter\\'s performance capabilities, resulting in a high rate of descent from which recovery was not possible. Factors contributing to the accident were high density altitude and the pilot\\'s decision to maneuver the helicopter in proximity to precipitous terrain, which effectively limited remedial options available.,The crew reported that they had a loss of fuel and were going to have to divert to Lajes AFB. Shortly thereafter, they said that they only had five minutes of fuel and probably would not reach Lajes. The Airbus 330, without engine power, glided for almost 20 minutes, descending from for more than 30,000 ft. before landing safely at Lajes Airport. Several tires blew out causing a fire which was quickly extinguished by emergency crews.  Eleven passengers were slightly injured. The leak was caused by a damaged fuel feed pipe that was caused by interference from the aft hydraulic pump. Mechanics did not completely follow a Rolls-Royce service bulletin. In addition, software mistakenly identified the  fuel leak as a fuel imbalance, prompting the crew to respond erroneously to the situation. The official report stated the cause was the pilots responded incorrectly to the fuel leak.  The pilots acted from memory rather than utilizing a checklist, so they never saw a \"Caution\" note in the Fuel Imbalance checklist that might have caused them to consider that the real problem was not an imbalance but a fuel leak.,Shortly after taking off the cargo plane crashed into a wooded area about one-half mile from the runway. The pilot\\'s failure to maintain a proper climb rate while taking off at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation. Factors in the accident were the low visibility and cloud conditions, and the dark night.,The aircraft crashed in flames approximately 200 ft. past the end of the runway while attempting to take off. The plane was overloaded by several hundred pounds and the weight improperly distributed, causing the pilot to lose control of the aircraft. R&B singer and actress Aaliyah Haughton, 22, was among those killed. Traces of cocaine and alcohol were found during the autopsy of the pilot. The plane was overloaded.,The aircraft crash-landed on a highway near Ruiz Picasso Airport in Málaga. While on final approach, the pilot reported failure of the plane\\'s left engine forcing the crew to make an emergency landing.  The plane crashed 1,300 ft. short of the runway. The pilot later died of his injuries.,The aircraft was hijacked shortly after it left Logan International Airport in Boston. The hijackers took control of the aircraft and deliberately crashed it into the south tower of the World Trade Center between the 78th and 84th floors at approximately 550 mph. After 56 minutes, the building collapsed. It was one of four planes that were hijacked the same day.,The aircraft was hijacked shortly after it left Logan International Airport in Boston. The hijackers took control of the aircraft and deliberately crashed it into the north tower of the World Trade Center between the 94th and 99th floors at approximately 450 mph.  After 102 minutes, the building collapsed. It was one of four planes that were hijacked the same day.,The aircraft was hijacked after taking off from Newark International Airport. The hijackers took control of the aircraft and turned the plane towards Washington D.C.

It did not stop turning and suddenly plunged to the ground.,The aircraft was taking off from Guatemala\\'s Aurora Airport when it lost power in one of it\\'s engines and crashed to the ground.,Witnesses to the accident reported that shortly after departing from the northbound turf runway the pilot initiated a 360-degree turn to the right (east). Shortly before completing the turn, the aircraft banked sharply to the left, pitched down, and collided with trees in a nose-low attitude. The pilot\\'s failure to maintain airspeed during a low altitude turn, resulting in a stall. The pilot exceeding the aircraft\\'s maximum gross takeoff weight was a factor.,The aircraft exploded in mid-air at 36,000 ft. while  en route over the Black Sea. The plane then nose-dived crashing into the water. The airliner was brought down accidentally by a Ukrainian surface-to-air missile, fired during military exercises.,The seaplane crashed into Mollet Lake while attempting to land. The seaplane stalled at an altitude that did not allow the pilot time to recover from the stall. The stall occurred in circumstances conducive to illusions created by drift.,The MD-87 aircraft was taking off from Linate Airport in fog and poor visibility when it struck a German Cessna Citation II business jet. The MD-87 rotated for takeoff and did make it into the air for 9 seconds, but was too damaged to sustain flight. The plane then swerved off the runway and  collided with the airport\\'s baggage handling building, bursting into flames. The Cessna,  which was about to take off for Paris, entered the active runway by mistake, after  having been told by the tower to enter a different taxiway and hold short of the runway. One hundred four passengers and 6 crew on the MD-87 and  2 passengers and 2 crew on the Citation were killed along with 4 on the ground. The MD-87 was named Lage Viking.  Caused largely by human error and poorly followed safety procedures and improper terminology used by the tower. Communication between the aircraft and the tower had been \"in English and Italian,\" as opposed to aviation standards that only English be spoken. In addition, despite the poor visibility and inadequately marked airport landmarks, the control tower operators failed to ask the Cessna to read back his instructions to make sure they were understood. There was no ground radar, runway motion sensors were turned off and it took 20 minutes before anyone realized the two planes had collided.,The plane was en-route from Barcelona, Spain to Oran, Algeria, 80 miles off the coast of Valencia, Spain when it informed Valencia ATC it was going to change course in order to avoid bad weather. There was no further contact with the aircraft. Debris was sighted two days later on the water. Electrical power was presumably lost following a lightning strike. Control was lost and the airplane crashed into the sea.,Shortly after taking off from Dillingham, the aircraft\\'s wing dipped, the nose pitched up, the plane became inverted and crashed to the ground. The weather was clear and windy at the time of the accident. An in-flight loss of control resulting from upper surface ice contamination that the pilot-in-command failed to detect during his preflight inspection of the airplane. Contributing to the accident was the lack of a preflight inspection requirement for CE-208 pilots to examine at close range the upper surface of the wing for ice contamination when ground icing conditions exist.,The air ambulance was flown into terrain during an overshoot because the required climb angle was not set and maintained to ensure a positive rate of climb. During the go-around, conditions were present for somatogravic illusion, which most likely led to the captain losing situational awareness.,Thirty minutes into the flight both engines quit and the pilot had to make an emergency landing in the rainforest.,The helicopter was flying very low because the pilot was not instrument rated. The skid hit the water followed by the tail rotor and the helicopter crashed. The pilot\\'s failure to maintain clearance from the surface of an open body of water while intentionally attempting to maintain a very low altitude while in cruise flight. Factors include falling snow, low ceilings, whiteout/greyout conditions, and flat/glassy water.,Three minutes after taking off and while in a climbing left turn, at 2,800 ft., parts of the plane, including the vertical stabilizer and rudder, fell from the aircraft. The crew soon lost control of the plane which nose dived and crashed into a residential neighborhood. After flying into the wake turbulence of two aircraft about two minutes into the flight, investigators believe a series of quick rudder swings by the copilot whipped the tail so severely that the fin broke off. The National Transportation Safety Board has found that pilot error was the probable cause. Sharply criticizing American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program, the Board said that American Airlines\\' pilot training included a simulator exercise which could have caused the first officer to have an unrealistic and exaggerated view of the effects of wake turbulence, erroneously associate wake turbulence encounters with the need for aggressive roll upset recovery techniques and develop control strategies that would produce a much different -- and potentially surprising and confusing -- response if performed during flight. In addition, because of its high sensitivity, the Airbus A-300-600 rudder control system is susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeed.,Residents heard a loud noise and saw flames in the night sky as the aircraft clipped treetops and summer homes before crashing into a snowy forest. Wreckage was spread over a 1.5 mile area. Serious maintenance violations and operational procedures were discovered during the investigation of the accident.,The cargo plane was not able to gain altitude, veered off the runway and crashed. The (undetermined) pilot-at-the-controls\\' early, and over rotation of the airplane\\'s nose during the takeoff attempt, and his failure to maintain directional control. Also causal, was the captain\\'s inadequate remedial action, both during the takeoff attempt and after the airplane departed the runway.,The plane crashed into a marshy forested area about 2 kilometer short of its destination at Kardla Airport. Several errors by the pilot.,The aircraft was flying through a mix of rain and snow on final approach, when it crashed in a wooded area, 5.5 miles from Zurich Airport where it was scheduled to land on Runway 28.  At 22.03 the aircraft was descending to 4000 ft. on final approach.  At 22.05 the captain reported reaching the minimum descent altitude and stated he could see the ground. Shortly after, the radio altimeter reported 500 ft. agl, followed by a \"minimum\" warning. A go-around was ordered, but it was too late and the aircraft struck trees and crashed. American pop singer, Melanie Thornton, 34, killed. Maria Serano Serano and Nathaly van het Ende both 27, and members of the pop-music trio, Passion Fruit, also killed. The pilot had been working more than 13 hours when the accident took place and had also exceeded maximum duty several times in the days preceding the crash. A controlled flight into terrain caused by the captain deliberately descending below the minimum descent altitude without having the required visual contact with either the approach lights or the runway and the copilot making no attempt to prevent the continuation of the flight below the minimum descent altitude. The report revealed that the pilot had failed to perform correct navigation and landing procedures before, but no action had been taken by the airline.  The range of hills the plane crashed into was not marked in the Jeppesen approach chart used by the crew, despite the hilly terrain the approach to runway 28 was not equipped with a minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) system, which triggers an alarm if a minimum safe altitude is violated, and the airport\\'s means of determining visibility were inadequate for runway 28 and the visual minimums at the time of the accident were actually inappropriate for using the standard approach to runway 28.,The cargo plane contacted the ground 700 meters short of the runway, broke in two and burned.,The plane crashed into Chontal Hill in the Tarrazú mountain range, 5 minutes before it was scheduled arrival at Quepos. The aircraft was flying IFR, in clouds, when it crashed into trees and broke apart. The plane was off to the left of its intended flight path.,A fire broke out aboard the aircraft while en route at FL290. The crew was preparing for an emergency landing when two explosions tore apart the plane causing it to crash.,The cargo plane crashed into high ground less than 5 miles from the airport while on an ILS approach. The poor in-flight planning by the pilot-in-command for his initiation of the ILS approach to runway 05 with weather conditions below minimums for the approach contrary to the Federal Aviation Regulations, and the failure of the pilot to maintain control of the airplane during a missed approach resulting in the in-flight collision with trees then terrain.,While enroute the cargo plane on a positioning flight entered an uncontroled descent and crashed.

Debris was spread across a 20 mile radius. Fifty-two children on a beach holiday were among the 69 aboard the Tupolev. The Tupolev pilot received contradictory instructions. The collision avoidance warning system (TCAS) told the pilot to ascend followed by an order from the Swiss air traffic controller to descend one second later. The Russian plane did not immediately respond to the tower\\'s order to descend, so he repeated the command 14 seconds later. Thirty seconds later the two planes collided. The Tupolev\\'s TCAS was telling the pilots to ascend. The Boeing\\'s TCAS was telling the pilots to descend. The Swiss air traffic controller was telling the Tupolev\\'s pilots to descend. The air traffic controller that guided the planes had no way of knowing the Russian pilot was receiving contradictory instruction from his cockpit TCAS unless told so by the pilot. Russian aviation officials said the pilot correctly gave precedence to the control tower, but Western aviation experts said pilots are trained to give precedence to the cockpit warning. In addition, the controller was left alone on duty while his partner went on a break and was preoccupied with another aircraft. This was accepted policy at Skyguide, the Swiss air control company. In addition, maintenance crews, working on the computer system, limited the controller\\'s information he was receiving including conflict alert warnings. Sadly, one-and-a-half years later, the controller, Peter Nielsen, was stabbed to death by a Russian man who had lost his wife and two children in the accident.,The aircraft crashed 2 miles short of the runway into the Guitangola neighborhood of Bangui.

Crew fatigue.,On a night repositioning flight, while en route, the stick shaker activated several times before the plane entered a aerodynamic stall. Almost simultaneously both engines stopped. The crew declared an emergency but the plane did not make the airport, crashed and broke up. PC:  The pilots\\' unprofessional behavior, deviation from standard operating procedures, and poor airmanship, which resulted in an in-flight emergency from which they were unable to recover, in part because of the pilots\\' inadequate training The pilots\\' failure to prepare for an emergency landing in a timely manner, including communicating with air traffic controllers immediately after the emergency about the loss of both engines and the availability of landing sites and the pilots\\' failure to achieve and maintain the target airspeed in the double engine failure checklist, which caused the engine cores to stop rotating and resulted in the core lock engine condition. Contributing to this accident was the engine core lock condition, which prevented at least one engine from being restarted, and the airplane flight manuals that did not communicate to pilots the importance of maintaining a minimum airspeed to keep the engine cores rotating.,During descent in poor weather, the cargo plane struck a mountain near the airport.,A few minutes after takeoff, the cargo plane struck the side Tagbao mountain a few  kilometers from the airport.,The turboprop crashed 4 miles south of Kirksville while on approach to Kirksville Municipal Airport. The plane clipped tree tops before crashing on its belly into a wooded area. Data show the plane descending then climbing slightly in the last four seconds before impact. The plane lacked a modern terrain warning system which would have been required equipment the next year. The pilots\\' failure to follow established procedures and properly conduct a nonprecision instrument approach at night in instrument meteorological conditions, including their descent below the minimum descent altitude before required visual cues were available (which continued unmoderated until the airplane struck the trees) and their failure to adhere to the established division of duties between the flying and nonflying pilots. Contributing to the accident were the pilots\\' failure to make standard callouts and the current Federal Aviation Regulations that allow pilots to descend below the MDA into a region in which safe obstacle clearance is not assured based upon seeing the airport approach lights. The pilots\\' failure to establish and maintain a professional demeanor during the flight and their fatigue likely contributed to their degraded performance.,Two minutes after taking off, the air ambulance crashed into Otay peak,  in an isolated area of mountains, 8 miles east of Brown Field Municipal Airport. Dark night visual conditions prevailed. The controller\\'s Minimum Safe Altitude Warning System issued and alert during the last two radar returns. The air traffic controller failed to alert the crew to altitude warnings as the plane was on track to fly into a mountain. The controller identified the airplane on the radar screen and instructed crew members to expect clearance above 5,000 feet, but then issued a heading that resulted in a flight track directly into the mountains. The mountain is at 3,556 feet altitude. Also, the flight crew did not follow the recommended departure procedures for taking off at night and in mountainous terrain. Failure of the flightcrew to maintain terrain clearance during a VFR departure, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain, and the air traffic controller\\'s issuance of a clearance that transferred the responsibility for terrain clearance from the fllightcrew to the controller. The controller\\'s failure to provide terrain clearance instructions to the flightcrew, and failure to advise the flightcrew of minimum safe altitude warning alerts. Contributing to the accident was the pilots\\' fatigue which likely contributed to their degraded decision making.,The plane struck a steep incline in the Bull Mountain area seven miles from the Blue Ridge Regional Airport in heavy fog.

There was light snow falling with fog and reduced visibility at the time of the accident.  Also, the pilot chose to take off from a 7,500 ft. runway rather than wait for the 10,000 ft. runway to be plowed. The youngest son of NBC sports chairman Dick Ebersol and actress Susan Saint James killed. St. James had just exited the accident vehicle before it took off. The flightcrew\\'s failure to ensure that the airplane\\'s wings were free of ice or snow contamination that accumulated while the airplane was on the ground, which resulted in an attempted takeoff with upper wing contamination that induced the a subsequent stall and collision with the ground. A factor contributing to the accident was the pilots\\' lack of experience flying during winter weather conditions.,Shortly after taking off the plane lost altitude and crashed on Howell Island a few miles from the airport.

One of the passenger\\'s infant fell into the river and drowned while exiting the aircraft.,While taking off on a training flight, the twin engine aircraft stalled and crashed near a petroleum facility near the airport.,The plane entered a spiral descent and broke up. It found the captain noticed a fuel imbalance and opened the crossfeed. This resulted in the plane being flown at a large sideslip angle while still under autopilot control, by means of the rudder trim mechanism. Forty-seven seconds after the cross flow was opened, there was a  \"bank angle\" warning, followed by a warning chime that was presumably a warning they were straying from their correct altitude. The autopilot disengaging, probably due to a servo reaching its torque limit. This meant that there was no compensation applied for the rudder trim input, and the plane entered a roll and steep descent, disintegrating around FL 199. The investigation found poor visibility at night in low cloud was a factor in preventing the pilots realizing sooner.,The plane was heading for the town of Isiro when it lost radio contact. As it was returning to Kisangani its propeller hit a tree and the plane lost control.,The plane crashed as it was preparing to land at the remote Aboriginal community of Lockhart River on Cape York peninsula.

In addition, the reverse thrust was not employed until 17 seconds after the wheels touched down.,The aircraft developed engine trouble while en route from Bari Italy to Djerba, Tunisia The crew contacted Palermo ATC for an emergency landing but ditched into the sea approximately 19 miles north of Palermo. The pilot reported that both engines had failed. Fuel starvation. The maintenance crew incorrectly installed a fuel gauge for a ATR-42 on the ATR-72. Both instruments look very similar. A contributing factor was the failure of the crew to carry out proper emergency procedures once the plane ran out of fuel. In March 2009, an Italian court sentenced the pilot, to 10 years of jail for manslaughter. Prosecutors said that after the plane\\'s engines stopped functioning, Garbi failed to follow emergency procedures, and that he could possibly have reached runway 25 of Palermo \"Punta Raisi\" Airport, or even the standard runway 20. Witnesses say he succumbed to panic and began praying out loud, rather than attempting to maneuver the plane to the nearest airport.,The helicopter crashed at sea about 3 miles off the coast near the island of Naissaar, after disappeared from Tallinn ATC radar 3 minutes after take-off from Tallinn in gusty wind conditions. Failure of the power steering system, caused by coating flaking off from servo pistons.

As the airliner entered Greek airspace ATC lost contact with the plane. Two Greek F-16 fighters were dispatched to intercept the plane. The F-16 pilots reported that one pilot was not in the cockpit and the other was slumped over the controls. They also said oxygen masks had deployed in the cabin. The plane continued on its programmed route to a holding pattern off the coast of Greece and flew in circles for two hours. Meanwhile, at least two flight attendants had stayed awake using portable oxygen bottles but they couldn\\'t get through the locked, terrorist-proof cockpit door. It was only when one engine failed from fuel starvation that the computer-controlled systems aboard the plane unlocked the door. The plane continued on track until it crashed into mountainous terrain about 25 miles north of Athens. CVR tapes showed that a student pilot/flight attendant, Andreas Prodromou, was at the controls of the aircraft and tried to send a Mayday message twice but the radio was set to the wrong frequency. The cabin pressure control was left in the manual, instead of auto position by maintenance workers. The error was not picked up by the two pilots during three subsequent check lists. They failed to respond to warnings as oxygen masks fell in the passenger cabin which eventually  led to the two pilots losing consciousness and the plane crashing.,While en route, the crew reported engine trouble with both engines and planed to divert to Caracas. The plane began losing altitude and eventually crashed in the Sierra de Perija mountains on the Columbian-Venezuelan border. The autopilot might have reduced engine power too much after a rapid climb to FL330, allowing airspeed to bleed off to the point of a stall. Also the data recorder showed that rather than push the nose over to recover from the stall, the pilots held the yoke to their chests all the way to the ground. It has also been suggesting that a buildup of ice inside each engine\\'s PT2 probe was responsible for the accident.,The plane was about to land at Pucallpa when it ran into strong winds from a tropical storm. The pilot tried to make an emergency landing without its landing gear on a road near the jungle airport. The plane crashed, broke up and caught fire about 2 miles from the airport.

Heavy snow was falling at the time of the accident. The plane had circled the airport for 30 to 35 minutes before attempting to land. The pilots\\' failure to use available reverse thrust in a timely manner to safely slow or stop the airplane after landing, which resulted in a runway overrun. This failure occurred because the pilots\\' first experience and lack of familiarity with the airplane\\'s autobrake system distracted them from thrust reverser usage during the challenging landing. Contributing to the accident were Southwest Airline\\'s 1) failure to provide its pilots with clear and consistent guidance and training regarding company policies and procedures related to arrival landing distance calculations; 2) programming and design of its onboard performance computer, which did not present inherent assumptions in the program critical to pilot decision making; 3) plan to implement new autobrake procedures without a familiarization period; and 4) failure to include a margin of safety in the arrival assessment to account for operational uncertainties. Also contributing to the accident was the pilots\\' failure to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking action and a tailwind component greater than 5 knots. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the absence of an engineering materials arresting system, which was needed because of the limited runway safety area beyond the departure end of runway 31C.,The plane crash-landed and burst into flames in a lightning storm while attempting to land at Port Harcourt Airport. Pilot error. The crew\\'s decision to continue to approach below the decision altitude without having the runway in sight.

Also, airports and aircraft should be equipped with instruments to detect windshear. In addition, it was recommended that airports and aircraft be equipped with instruments to detect windshear.,The seaplane crashed off Miami Beach next to a jetty as it was taking off. There was an explosion and fire and the right wing separated prior to the plane impacting the water. Examination of the wreckage revealed fatigue cracks in the right wing. The failure of Chalk\\'s Ocean Airways\\' maintenance program to identify and properly repair fatigue cracks in the wing, and the failure of the FAA to detect and correct deficiencies in the company\\'s maintenance program. Although a 16-inch crack in the wing had been patched, a more significant flaw in a nearby support beam hadn\\'t been repaired. The carrier had no record of patching the crack.,The plane crashed along the shore of the Caspian Sea 8 minutes after taking off from Baku. Instrument failure left the crew unable to control the aircraft.,On final approach the plane crashed into an open field 2,200 feet short of the runway threshold.

The weather at the time of the crash was mostly cloudy with winds gusting to 29 mph and 6 miles visibility. The pilot\\'s failure to maintain control of the airplane during cruise flight, which resulted in an uncontrolled descent, and an in-flight collision with snow-covered terrain. Contributing to the accident were the pilot\\'s spatial disorientation, and dark night conditions.,The pilot chose to initiate his take off from about 200 metres beyond the threshold of Runway 31 because he was not certain of the condition of the runway behind that position. He chose to apply full power on brakes and leaned the mixtures before initiating the take off roll. As the aircraft rolled for take off the pilot reported to have felt acceleration/deceleration effects caused by undulations and wetness of the runway. The target rotation speed was 105kt. However, the pilot had to rotate at around 96kt when it became imminent that the remaining runway length was not enough to stop the aircraft. Shortly after take off the pilot felt a complete lack of acceleration and had to lower the nose in order to increase airspeed. As he did so, the aircraft collided with a roof of a house located about 500 metres beyond the threshold of Runway 13. The aircraft subsequently collided with 3 more houses and an electric pole with live cables and broke up.,While flying at FL350 the airliner went missing between Surabaya and Manado in poor weather conditions after the pilot reported strong winds. Wreckage was found 5 miles south of Parepare. The accident was caused by the autopilot being accidentally disconnected.

One passenger was killed.,The jet airliner crashed while attempting to land in heavy rain at Congonhas airport. The plane skidded off the end of the runway across a major roadway and struck a gas station and building, bursting into flames.  The right engine had a malfunctioning reverser. In this situation, the correct procedure was for the pilot to retard both throttles to idle and then advance both throttles to reverse, as if he had no problem with the reversers. The former procedure, which was changed by Airbus, was to take both throttles to idle, and then advance just the throttle corresponding to the engine with the operating reverser. It was changed by Airbus because there had been several incidents where the pilot forgot to bring both throttles back to idle, leaving one engine reversed and the other thrusting forward. The downside to this change was it would lengthen the stopping distance. The pilot was so concerned about the short and slippery runway that he chose to switch to the old procedure and got it wrong. A contributing factor was the heavy rain and wind and the fact that the newly resurfaced runway had not had grooves installed yet.,The cargo plane crashed shortly after taking off after an engine failed. The pilot was trying to return for an emergency landing.,The single engine aircraft crashed onto a heavily forested mountain, 30 miles east of Ketchican while on a sightseeing trip over Misty Fiords.

An investigation showned that the fuel flow to both engines was restricted; most probably due to ice within the fuel feed system. The ice is likely to have formed from water that occurred naturally in the fuel, and should have been melted by the fuel-oil heat\\nexchanger (FOHE).  However, the FOHE did not heat its own inlet  face, and investigation showed that, although the flight was   within the certified operational envelope at all times, a long   period of low fuel flow in an unusually cold environment, followed  by a throttle increase, could cause an ice jam at that point. Corrections in design were made so this would not occur again.,The twin engine plane crashed into mountains in rain and fog.

One person survived the accident but died later. The pilots  were both working on insufficient sleep and displayed poor coordination with one another. The pilots failed to account for a wet runway and 8-knot tailwind when they touched down on the 5,500-foot runway, and they should have applied a braking system a full seven seconds earlier than they did.Realizing they were running out of runway, the pilots hit the throttles to try to take off again. Had the pilots hit the lift dump right after touchdown, or landed into the wind, the plane probably could have stopped safely on the runway. The accident was due to the captain\\'s decision to attempt a go-around late in the landing roll with insufficient runway remaining. Contributing to the accident were the pilots\\' poor crew coordination and lack of cockpit discipline.; fatigue, which likely impaired both pilots\\' performance and failure of the FAA to require crew resource management training and standard operating procedures for Part 135 operators.,The plane crashed in a remote mountanous region of Vancouver Island while en route on a short 30 minute flight.

A preliminary investigation found the jet\\'s pilots didn\\'t immediately follow instructions to slow down and appeared to be nearly one nautical mile too close behind a Boeing 767-300 on the same flight path to Mexico City\\'s international airport. In addition, neither pilot had legitimate certification to fly. Wake turbulence.,The on-demand taxi was transporting a organ recipient and his wife. While attempting to land in below minimum conditions, the plane descended below the glide slope and crashed into trees about 4,100 feet from the runway threshold. The pilot\\'s failure to maintain the proper gidepath during an ILS approach. Contributing to the accident were the pilot\\'s decision to indicate the ILS approach with weather below the published minimums, and the pilot\\'s self-induced pressure to expeditiously transport a organ recipient to a hospital.,After taking off, the aircraft climbed to 12,500 feet. While cruising at this altitude, the aircraft was caught in a violent gust that initially pushed the plane upwards and towards the mountain. As the pilot tried to steer the aircraft away from the mountain, he realized that the airspeed had decayed to 40 kts., indicating an imminent stall. He decided to dive in order to gain air speed. As he did so the VSI indicated a rate of sink of 2,000 feet per minute while the airspeed remained at 40 kts. Visibility was poor and the pilot did not see the ground till impact at 14,399 feet. Four Italian tourists were killed. Only the pilot survived. It is therefore very likely that the aircraft was caught in a mountain wave that caused the sudden altitude gain and the subsequent stall.,The cargo plane, chartered by FedEx, crashed west of Baghdad, shortly after taking off from al Asad air base and after the crew reported a malfunction with the plane.,The charter aircraft crashed into a steep hillside on south Thormanby Island 19 minutes after taking off and exploded into flames.

Probably crashed into the ocean. Never found.,Crashed while attempting to land. The probable cause of this accident was the flight crew\\'s failure to monitor and maintain a minimum safe airspeed while executing an instrument approach in icing conditions, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at low altitude. Contributing to the accident were 1) the flight crew\\'s failure to follow published standard operating procedures in response to a flap anomaly, 2) the captain\\'s decision to continue with the unstabilized approach, 3) the flight crew\\'s poor crew resource management, and 4) fatigue due to the time of day in which the accident occurred and a cumulative sleep debt, which likely impaired the captain\\'s performance.,A helicopter bound for offshore oil fields went down about 75 miles southwest of New Orleans shortly after taking off. The sudden loss of power to both engines that resulted from impact with a red-tailed hawk, which fractured the windshield and interfered with engine fuel controls and the subsequent disorientation of the flightcrrew members. Also the lack of FAA regulations and guidance at the time the helicopter was certificated requiring helicopter windshields to be resistant to bird strikes and the lack of protections that would prevent T-handles from inadvertently dislodging out of the detents and the lack of a master warning light and audible system to alert the flightcrew of low-rotor speed conditions.,The plane was taking off from La Guardia Airport when both engines were disabled after striking a flock of geese.

Preliminary evidence suggests the crew selected the landing gear down and set the flaps 15 degrees. Immediately after selecting the flaps the stick shaker activated. The captain then pulled on the controls, slowing the airplane even further causing the plane to stall. Colgan Air officials acknowledged that both pilots apparently were not paying close attention to the aircraft\\'s instruments and failed to follow the airline\\'s procedures for handling an impending stall in the final minutes of the flight. The captain’s inappropriate response to the activation of the stick shaker, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which the airplane did not recover. Contributing to the accident were (1) the flight crew’s failure to monitor airspeed in relation to the rising position of the low-speed cue, (2) the flight crew’s failure to adhere to sterile cockpit procedures, (3) the captain’s failure to effectively manage the flight, and (4) Colgan Air’s inadequate procedures for airspeed selection and management during approaches in icing conditions.,The helicopter was carrying firemen to a nearby forest fire when it crashed into a fog shrouded mountain killing all aboard.,While attemping to take off from Luxor, the cargo plane slammed to the ground, slid down the runway and caught fire.,The plane was on final approach to Runway 18R when it crashed 1 mile short of the runway into a field and broke in three.

The plane departed from Rio de Janeiro-Galeao International Airport at 19:03 LT bound for Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. The last radio contact with the flight was at 01:33 UTC.  The aircraft left CINDACTA III radar coverage at 01:48 UTC, flying normally at FL350. The aircraft reportedly went through a thunderstorm with strong turbulence at 02:00 UTC. At 02:14 UTC an automated message was received indicating a failure of the electrical system. The plane carried 12 crew members and 216 passengers. The wreckage was finally discovered on April 3, 2011 using unmanned submarines.  Flight447 passed into clouds associated with a large system of thunderstorms, its speed sensors became iced over, and the autopilot disengaged. In the ensuing confusion, the pilots lost control of the airplane because they reacted incorrectly to the loss of instrumentation and then seemed unable to comprehend the nature of the problems they had caused. Neither weather nor malfunction doomed flight, nor a complex chain of error, but a simple but persistent mistake on the part of one of the pilots. \\n  The crew did not realize the plane was in a stall, were insufficiently trained in flying manually, and never informed the passengers that anything was wrong before they plunged into the sea. The captain was on a rest break when the warnings began. The two co-pilots were facing faulty speed readings from unreliable sensors and repeated alarm signals, but fail to explain why the pilots responded the way they did. It\\'s unclear why the co-pilot at the controls maintained a nose-up input - contrary to the normal procedure to come out of an aerodynamic stall. Normally, the nose should be pointed slightly downward to regain lift in such a stall, often caused because the plane is traveling too slowly. A basic maneuver for stall recovery, which pilots are taught at the outset of their flight training, is to push the yoke forward and apply full throttle to lower the nose of the plane and build up speed. The report confirms that external speed sensors obstructed by ice crystals produced irregular speed readings on the plane. Since the accident, Air France has replaced the speed monitors on all its Airbus A330 and A340 aircraft. The BEA said neither of the co-pilots at the controls had received recent training for manual aircraft handling, or had any high-altitude schooling in case of unreliable air speed readings. A stall warning sounded numerous times, and once for a full 54 seconds, but the crew made no reference to it in cockpit exchanges before the jet crashed.,The air ambulance crashed into hills while attempting to land in heavy fog about 4 miles from the airport.,While en route and nearing it\\'s destination, the cargo plane crashed into a 9,600 ft. mountain in the Tangma district.,The plane crashed into the Indian Ocean, 10 miles off the coast,while attempting a second approach to Hahaya Airport in Moroni.

We wanted to get an idea of what types of things most commonly influence or cause plane crashes to occur. For example, we saw in the crash summaries that the word \"mountain\" occured frequently, and thus decided it would be interesting to count the number of times that word appears in any of the crash descriptions in the data set. We found that the word occured in the data 549 times!**"

Over the last several decades, commerical flights have steadily increased while the likelihood of flight crashing has steadily decreased. Airline passengers should feel more safe now than ever, especially when traveling with a trustworthy airline. After our numerous graphs and calculations, we feel more comfortable about our airline travel in the future. Lastly, this project has greatly strengthed our knowledge and understanding in using pandas, numpy, and matplotlib when programming with Python."
